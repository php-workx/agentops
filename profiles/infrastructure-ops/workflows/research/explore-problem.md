# Explore Problem Space

Map the problem, identify existing solutions, and gather context.

## Core Process

1. **Understand the problem**
   - What is being solved?
   - Why does it matter?
   - What are the constraints?

2. **Find existing solutions**
   - Search codebase for related implementations
   - Look for similar patterns
   - Identify what already works

3. **Gather context**
   - Understand current state
   - Identify integration points
   - Note dependencies

4. **Document findings**
   - Map the landscape
   - List what exists
   - Note constraints

## Output

Section in `research.md`:
- Problem understanding
- Existing implementations found
- Context map
- Constraints identified
