# Design Solution

Transform research findings into detailed implementation design.

## Core Process

1. **Review research**
   - Understand recommendation
   - Identify critical constraints
   - Note dependencies

2. **Design approach**
   - How will we implement this?
   - In what order?
   - What are the checkpoints?

3. **Specify changes**
   - Which files change?
   - What's the before/after?
   - What commands run?

4. **Plan validation**
   - How do we know it worked?
   - What are success criteria?
   - How do we rollback?

## Output

Section in `plan.md`:
- Detailed approach
- Phase-by-phase breakdown
- Specific file changes
- Validation strategy
- Rollback plan
