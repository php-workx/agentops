# agentops Core

The minimal, universal constitutional foundation for specification-driven AI agent workflows.

## Contents

- `primers/` - Core interactive primers (/prime, /prime-complex, /prime-debug)
- `hooks/` - Git enforcement (pre-commit, commit-msg, post-commit)
- `templates/` - Pattern templates for extensions

## The Constitution

The core enforces:
- Five Laws (mandatory practices)
- Three Rules (operational constraints)
- 40% Rule (context engineering)
- Four Pillars (foundational principles)

## Specs-Driven Pattern

All work follows:

```
RESEARCH
  → gather requirements, understand scope
PLAN
  → write detailed specifications
IMPLEMENT
  → follow the spec precisely
```

This ensures agents have clarity before execution.

## Installation

Installed automatically by profiles. Provides the universal foundation that all profiles extend.
