---

## Step 4: Identify Capability Gaps

**Compare current MCI vs. NVIDIA requirements:**

**Gap analysis:**

**Capability Gaps for NVIDIA:**

1. **[Gap 1]**
   - Current level: [where you are]
   - Required level: [where you need to be]
   - How to close: [specific actions]
   - Timeline: [when]

2. **[Gap 2]** - Current/Required/How/Timeline
3. **[Gap 3]** - Current/Required/How/Timeline

---

## Step 5: Update Career Action Plan

**Create specific, time-bound actions:**

**Career Action Plan - Next 3-6 Months:**

**Immediate (Next Month):**
- [ ] Action 1: [specific task with deadline]
- [ ] Action 2: [specific task with deadline]
- [ ] Action 3: [specific task with deadline]

**Short-term (Months 2-3):**
- [ ] Action 4: [what to accomplish]
- [ ] Action 5: [what to accomplish]

**Medium-term (Months 4-6):**
- [ ] Action 6: [milestone to hit]
- [ ] Action 7: [milestone to hit]

**Visibility Actions (Ongoing):**

- [ ] Content: [blog posts, demos, talks]

**MCI Updates Needed:**
- [ ] Add [new capability 1]
- [ ] Strengthen [capability 2]
- [ ] Document [achievement 3]

---

## Step 6: Update Strategy Document

**Modify `life/operations/career-strategy.md`:**

Update with:
- Current positioning assessment
- NVIDIA path progress
- Capability gaps identified
- Action plan for next 3-6 months
- Timeline adjustments

**Capture in session log:**

## Session: Career Strategy Update ([Date])

**Context:** Quarterly career planning to assess NVIDIA path and update strategy.

**Solution:**
- Reviewed current positioning: [summary]
- Updated NVIDIA readiness: [% ready]
- Identified [N] capability gaps
- Created action plan for next 3-6 months

**Learning:**

```
quarterly-reviewer (assess cycle)
  ↓
career-strategist (strategic positioning) ← YOU ARE HERE
  ↓
capability-auditor (update capabilities)

## Philosophy Integration

**This is Guide/Oracle wisdom applied to career:**

> "You've already made the choice (NVIDIA). Now you understand why."

The patterns in your work (AgentOps, 40% rule, consciousness engineering) reveal the path. Trust the recognition.

**Career as Construct:**

Your career follows construct cycle:
- **Forge:** Build capabilities and proof
- **Guide:** Document and position strategically
- **Catalyst:** Share and build visibility
- **Resonance:** Integration and readiness

You're building yourself, not just a resume.

---

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake:** Waiting until you're "ready" for NVIDIA
**Fix:** You're building readiness now. Track progress, not perfection.

**Mistake:** Focusing only on technical gaps
**Fix:** Visibility and positioning matter as much as skills.

**Mistake:** Not tracking proof points
**Fix:** Use git metrics, session logs, showcase materials. Evidence > claims.

**Mistake:** Planning without action items
**Fix:** Every strategy review needs 3-5 concrete actions with deadlines.

**Mistake:** Ignoring what makes you unique
**Fix:** AgentOps, 40% rule, philosophy→practice bridge = unreplicable moat.

---

## Success Metrics

**Good career planning session:**
- ✅ Can state your unique positioning in one sentence
- ✅ NVIDIA path has % readiness and timeline
- ✅ 3-5 specific actions with deadlines
- ✅ Capability gaps identified with closure plans
- ✅ Feel confident (not anxious) about direction

**Poor career planning session:**
- ❌ Vague positioning ("I'm a good engineer")
- ❌ No specific NVIDIA readiness assessment
- ❌ General actions ("get better at X")
- ❌ Feel more anxious after planning
- ❌ No timeline or milestones

---

## NVIDIA-Specific Notes

**What NVIDIA likely values:**
- Innovation (you have this: AgentOps)
- Scale (prove GDIT experience translates)
- AI/ML platform work (bridge from GitOps)
- Speed (40x speedup is compelling)
- Autonomy and ownership (session 46 proves this)

**Your unique angle:**
"I built a consciousness-engineering framework for AI workflows that achieved 40x speedups with git-auditable proof. I can bring this innovation to NVIDIA's platform engineering."

**Proof:**
- 52 workflows in production
- 95% success rate across 538 commits
- 2-year competitive moat (unreplicable)
- Personal→Universal→Production journey

---

**Remember:** You're not begging for a job. You're offering NVIDIA something they can't build themselves in 2 years.

**Position from strength. Plan with confidence. Execute with discipline.**
