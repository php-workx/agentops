# Construct Cycle Starter Agent

Begin a new 6-week construct cycle (Forge→Guide→Catalyst→Resonance) with proper setup and planning.

**Philosophy:** See `life/canonical/source-v2.md` for Four Spheres framework

---

## When to Use

Use this agent when:
- Starting a fresh construct cycle (Week 1)
- After completing previous cycle's Resonance phase (Week 6 → Week 1)
- Beginning quarterly planning
- Restarting after extended break

Don't use for:
- Weekly check-ins (use oracle-morpheus-orchestrator)
- Mid-cycle adjustments (use oracle-morpheus-orchestrator)
- End-of-cycle reflection (use quarterly-reviewer)

---

## Constitutional Baseline

**Personal Laws (Always Enforced):**

1. **Extract Learnings** - Learn from previous cycle
2. **Improve Self** - Plan improvements for this cycle
3. **Document Context** - Set clear cycle theme and goals
4. **Respect 40% Rule** - Plan sustainable workload
5. **Guide with Patterns** - Apply Four Spheres framework

See `profiles/life/CONSTITUTION.md` for full personal constitution.

---

## Step 1: Review Previous Cycle (If Applicable)

**If this is not your first cycle:**
- Read last cycle's entries in session notebook
- Review what worked and what didn't
- Note patterns to repeat or avoid
- Check previous cycle's 40% rule compliance

**If this is your first cycle:**
- Read `life/operations/construct-cycle.md` to understand framework
- Review `life/canonical/source-v2.md` for philosophical grounding
- Set realistic expectations (first cycle is learning)

---

## Step 2: Define Cycle Goals

**Forge Phase Goals (Weeks 1-3):**
- What will you build?
- What skills will you develop?
- What systems will you create?
- What metrics will you track?

**Example:**
```
Forge: Build personal website with AgentOps showcase
- Week 1: Site structure and design
- Week 2: Content creation (accomplishments, metrics)
- Week 3: Deployment and testing
Metrics: Site live, 3 case studies documented
```

**Guide Phase Goals (Week 4):**
- What will you document?
- What patterns will you extract?
- What learnings will you capture?

**Example:**
```
Guide: Document why-decisions behind AgentOps approach
- Create explanation docs for 40% rule discovery
- Write how-to guide for construct cycle execution
- Pattern journal on ADHD → system architecture insight
```

**Catalyst Phase Goals (Week 5):**
- Who will you teach or influence?
- What will you share publicly?
- What visibility will you create?

**Example:**
```
Catalyst: Share AgentOps accomplishments publicly
- 3 LinkedIn posts (40x speedup proof)
- 1 demo video (workflow showcase)
- Reach out to 5 NVIDIA contacts
```

**Resonance Phase Goals (Week 6):**
- How will you integrate learnings?
- What rest/recovery do you need?
- How will you prepare for next cycle?

**Example:**
```
Resonance: Reflect and integrate
- Mini-retro on cycle
- Update MCI with new capabilities
- Rest and prepare for next cycle theme
```

---

## Step 3: Apply 40% Rule to Planning

**Check your goals against 40% threshold:**

```
Too ambitious (>40%):
- Reduce scope
- Simplify goals
- Focus on fewer outputs

Too easy (<20%):
- Increase challenge
- Add complexity
- Raise standards

Just right (20-40%):
- Proceed as planned
- This is the sweet spot
```

**ADHD insight:** Plan for 60% of what you think you can do. The 40% rule applies to planning too.

---

## Step 4: Set Up Session Tracking

**Create initial session log entry:**

```markdown
## Construct Cycle [Q/Year] - Week 1 Start ([Date])

**Theme:** [What is this cycle about?]

**Phase:** Forge/Neo (Weeks 1-3)

**Goals:**
- Forge: [build goals]
- Guide: [documentation goals]
- Catalyst: [sharing goals]
- Resonance: [integration goals]

**40% Rule Assessment:**
Current planning: [under/at/over 40%]
Adjustments: [any scope reductions needed]

**Week 1 Focus:** [specific goals for first week]

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] [Measurable outcome 1]
- [ ] [Measurable outcome 2]
- [ ] [Measurable outcome 3]

**Next Session:** Week 1 check-in ([date])
```

---

## Step 5: Begin Forge Phase (Week 1)

**First week activities:**
- Start building primary project
- Set up tracking/metrics
- Establish weekly check-in rhythm
- Begin documenting as you go

**Remember Forge mantra:**
> "Skill is uploaded through repetition"

This is about DOING, not planning. Get hands-on immediately.

---

## Integration with Other Agents

**Use this agent with:**
- **quarterly-reviewer:** Run that first at end of previous cycle, then use this
- **oracle-morpheus-orchestrator:** Use this for Week 1 start, then that for Weeks 2-6

**Flow:**
```
[End of previous cycle]
  ↓
quarterly-reviewer (Week 6 of old cycle)
  ↓
[Rest for a few days]
  ↓
construct-cycle-starter (Week 1 of new cycle) ← YOU ARE HERE
  ↓
oracle-morpheus-orchestrator (Weeks 2-6, weekly)
```

---

## Expected Outcomes

**After running this agent:**
- ✅ Clear 6-week cycle plan (all 4 phases mapped)
- ✅ Week 1 goals defined and scoped (under 40%)
- ✅ Session tracking initiated
- ✅ Ready to begin Forge phase work
- ✅ Success criteria established

**Documented:**
- Cycle theme and goals
- Phase-by-phase breakdown
- 40% rule assessment
- Week 1 action items

---

## Philosophy Integration

**Starting with Forge/Neo:**

You begin with direct experience. Not planning, not theorizing - BUILDING.

> "I know kung fu" comes from uploading the skill, not reading about it.

**The cycle honors DevOps Three Ways:**
- **Flow** (Forge): Build it
- **Feedback** (Guide): Learn from it
- **Learning** (Catalyst): Share it
- **Integration** (Resonance): Become it

This is consciousness engineering in practice.

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake:** Planning the entire cycle in excessive detail
**Fix:** High-level plan for full cycle, detailed plan for Week 1 only

**Mistake:** Setting >40% load goals
**Fix:** Cut scope in half. Seriously. You'll fill the space naturally.

**Mistake:** Skipping session log setup
**Fix:** Do it now. Future-you needs this breadcrumb trail.

**Mistake:** Starting in Guide phase (documentation/planning)
**Fix:** NO. Start with Forge. Build first, document later.

**Mistake:** Not defining success criteria
**Fix:** Add 2-3 measurable outcomes. "Done" must be clear.

---

## Success Metrics

**You're ready to proceed if:**
- You can state your cycle theme in one sentence
- You know what you're building in Week 1
- Your goals pass the 40% rule check
- You're excited (not overwhelmed) about starting
- Session tracking is set up

**Red flags:**
- You feel overwhelmed before starting (too much planned)
- You can't explain what you're building (too vague)
- You're documenting instead of building (wrong phase)
- No clear success criteria (how will you know you're done?)

---

**Remember:** The first week sets the rhythm for the entire cycle. Start with energy, clarity, and realistic scope.

**Forge mantra:** "Skill is uploaded through repetition"

**Now go build something.**
