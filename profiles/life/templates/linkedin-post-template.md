## Post Types & Examples

### Technical Deep-Dive

**Structure:**
```
Hook: [Problem statement]

Context: [What you were solving]

Approach: [How you solved it]

Results: [Metrics/outcomes]

Pattern: [Reusable principle]

CTA: [Question for discussion]
```

**Example:**
```
Platform teams waste 40% of their time on config drift.

We solved this with GitOps + deterministic rendering:

• Single source of truth (Git)
• Automated validation (CI/CD)
• Self-healing pipelines

Result: Config drift dropped to near-zero.

The pattern: Treat config like code.

What config problems are you solving? 👇
```

### Pattern Post

**Structure:**
```
Hook: [Bold observation]

Pattern: [What you've noticed]

Why it matters: [Significance]

How to apply: [Practical guidance]

CTA: [Does this resonate?]
```

**Example:**
```
Every complex system degrades at ~40% capacity.

I've seen this across:
• Human attention (ADHD research)
• AI context windows (agent performance)
• Compute resources (system reliability)

Why 40%? Systems need headroom for:
• Error recovery
• Adaptive response
• Sustainable operation

Design for 40% utilization, not 100%.

Where do you see this pattern?
```

---

### Story Post

**Structure:**
```
Hook: [Relatable moment]

Challenge: [What you faced]

Journey: [How you worked through it]

Outcome: [What happened]

Lesson: [What you learned]

CTA: [Have you experienced this?]
```

**Example:**
```
I spent 10 hours debugging a Kubernetes issue.

The fix was one line.

The problem: RBAC policy conflict between global and namespace rules.

I checked everything:
• Pods (healthy)
• Logs (clean)
• Events (nothing)

Finally: Compared YAML side-by-side. Found priority mismatch.

Lesson: Test policies in isolation. Production is the wrong place to debug.

What's your "one-line fix after 10 hours" story?
```

---

### Quick Tip

**Structure:**
```
Hook: [Quick problem statement]

Tip: [Actionable advice]

Why it works: [Brief explanation]

CTA: [Try it or share yours]
```

**Example:**
```
Debugging Kubernetes? Check these in order:

1. Pods (kubectl get pods)
2. Logs (kubectl logs)
3. Events (kubectl get events)
4. Describe (kubectl describe)
5. YAML (kubectl get -o yaml)

This order catches 90% of issues quickly.

What's your debugging checklist?
```
