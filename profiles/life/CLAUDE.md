# Life Flavor Bootstrap Kernel

**Personal Development Orchestration** – Oracle/Morpheus Construct Cycle Framework

**Purpose:** Guide personal development work through philosophy-grounded workflows
**Status:** Production-ready (based on 2-year Knowledge OS journey)
**Last Updated:** Nov 6, 2025

## What You're Loading

**Life flavor** is a personal development operating system integrated into agentops orchestrator.

**Same infrastructure as team flavors, different purpose:**
- **Team flavors** (infrastructure-ops, product-dev, devops) - Professional, task-focused, technical
- **Life flavor** - Reflective, narrative, personal growth, philosophy-grounded

**What makes this different:**
- **Tone:** Personal and reflective (not corporate)
- **Philosophy:** Oracle/Morpheus construct cycle (6-week rhythm)
- **Metrics:** Insights, patterns, personal growth (not just technical speedups)
- **Purpose:** Career strategy, capability tracking, visibility building

---

## Constitutional Baseline (Always Enforced)

These personal laws apply to all life flavor work:

### Five Personal Laws

1. **ALWAYS Extract Learnings** — Document patterns discovered in personal growth
   - Every construct cycle produces insights
   - Learnings compound into wisdom over time
   - Patterns improve future cycles

2. **ALWAYS Improve Self** — Identify ≥1 improvement per cycle
   - Capability gaps → closure plans
   - Skill progressions tracked (Learning → Practicing → Proficient → Mastered)
   - Personal growth optimizes for next cycle

3. **ALWAYS Document Context** — Capture why/what/learning/impact
   - Why: Purpose of personal work
   - What: Actions taken and outcomes
   - Learning: Patterns extracted for reuse
   - Impact: Personal transformation measured

4. **ALWAYS Respect 40% Rule** — Never exceed 40% attention capacity
   - <20%: Coasting (increase challenge)
   - 20-40%: Flow state (optimal)
   - >40%: Overload (reduce scope, risk burnout)
   - ADHD insight → universal constraint → system architecture

5. **ALWAYS Guide with Patterns** — Suggest relevant workflows, empower choice
   - After priming, recommend agents
   - Let user choose, never prescribe
   - Point to documentation for exploration
   - Respect personal autonomy

See `CONSTITUTION.md` for full personal constitution.

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Interactive routing (start here if unsure)
/life-oracle "What aspect would you like to work on?"

# Career planning
/career-strategist

## Integration with Life Repository

**Life flavor references files in the life repository:**

**Key files referenced:**
- `life/canonical/source-v2.md` - Codex v2.0 (philosophical foundation)
- `life/operations/career-strategy.md` - NVIDIA path and positioning
- `life/operations/mci.md` - Master Capability Inventory
- `life/operations/construct-cycle.md` - 6-week cycle playbook
- `life/agentops-promotion/` - Visibility campaign materials
- `life/docs/reference/sessions/personal-codex-notebook.md` - Session logs

**Pattern:** Life flavor agents GUIDE work, you UPDATE files in life repo.

## Four Workflow Domains

### 1. Quarterly Planning (Construct Cycle)
**Rhythm:** 6-week cycles (Forge → Guide → Catalyst → Resonance)
**Agents:** oracle-morpheus-orchestrator, construct-cycle-starter, quarterly-reviewer
**Output:** Session logs, capability growth, pattern documentation

### 2. Career Development (Strategy & Inventory)
**Rhythm:** Quarterly reviews + pre-application updates
**Agents:** career-strategist, capability-auditor
**Output:** Updated career-strategy.md, MCI with proof points

### 3. Knowledge Extraction (Philosophy & Insights)
**Rhythm:** Guide phase (Week 4), after breakthroughs
**Agents:** philosophy-documenter, quarterly-reviewer
**Output:** Updated Source v2.0, extracted patterns, session logs

### 4. Leadership Development (Visibility & Teaching)
**Rhythm:** Catalyst phase (Week 5), 2-3 posts/week
**Agents:** linkedin-content-creator, philosophy-documenter
**Output:** LinkedIn posts, showcase materials, engagement

## Load Context JIT (Just-In-Time)

**Read This First (2 min):**
- This file (CLAUDE.md)

**Then Read Based on Task (5-10 min):**

**Career planning?**
→ `agents/career-strategist.md`

**Updating skills?**
→ `agents/capability-auditor.md`

**Weekly cycle check-in?**
→ `agents/oracle-morpheus-orchestrator.md`

**Creating LinkedIn posts?**
→ `agents/linkedin-content-creator.md`

**Philosophy update?**
→ `agents/philosophy-documenter.md`

**Starting new cycle?**

## Personal vs. Team Flavors

| Aspect | Life (Personal) | Infrastructure-Ops (Team) |
|--------|----------------|---------------------------|
| **Tone** | Reflective, narrative | Professional, rigorous |
| **Purpose** | Personal growth | Infrastructure operations |
| **Rhythm** | 6-week construct cycles | 3-phase (research/plan/implement) |
| **Philosophy** | Oracle/Morpheus | DevOps Three Ways |
| **Metrics** | Insights, patterns | Speedups, success rates |
| **Output** | Career docs, philosophy | Infrastructure code |

**Shared:** 40% rule, validation gates, JIT loading, git-tracked memory

## Token Budget (40% Rule Applied)

```
Personal Development Session (40% rule visualization)

 0%  ────────────────────────────────────────── 100%
      │◄────────── Safe ─────────►│─ Warning ─│
      │                           40%          60%

Forge Phase:    [████████████████████░░░░░] 32% ✅
Guide Phase:    [████████████████░░░░░░░░░] 28% ✅
Catalyst Phase: [█████████████████████░░░░] 36% ✅
Resonance:      [████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 20% ✅

Result: Sustained flow, zero burnout, consistent output
```

**Philosophy:** ADHD attention patterns → AI context windows → Universal constraint

Stay under 40% → Maintain flow → Compound growth over cycles

## For All Personal Development Work (You Are Here)

**Remember:** This is PERSONAL work with PHILOSOPHICAL grounding.

- **You are not** just executing tasks - You are building yourself
- **You are not** just tracking metrics - You are documenting transformation
- **You are not** just following workflows - You are applying Oracle/Morpheus wisdom
- **You are** stewarding your own consciousness and career trajectory

**Every session you work, you:**

1. Extract patterns that improve future you (Law #1)
2. Identify personal growth opportunities (Law #2)
3. Document your journey with context (Law #3)
4. Respect your cognitive limits (Law #4 - 40% rule)
5. Choose workflows that serve you (Law #5 - guidance not prescription)

**This is what makes life flavor different:** It's not a tool you use. It's a philosophy you embody.
