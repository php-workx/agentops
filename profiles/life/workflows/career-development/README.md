# Career Development Workflows

**Purpose:** Strategic career planning, capability tracking, and application preparation.

**Philosophy:** Career development is consciousness applied to professional trajectory.

## Overview

These workflows guide career strategy and capability management:

1. **nvidia-path-workflow.md** - NVIDIA application strategy and positioning
2. **mci-maintenance-workflow.md** - Master Capability Inventory maintenance

---

## When to Use Each Workflow

| Workflow | Use When | Time | Agent |
|----------|----------|------|-------|
| **nvidia-path-workflow** | NVIDIA applications, quarterly career reviews | 30-60m | career-strategist |
| **mci-maintenance-workflow** | After projects, before applications, quarterly | 20-30m | capability-auditor |

## The Career Strategy Pattern

```
Philosophy (Source v2.0)
    ↓
Strategy (10-year vision + positioning)
    ↓
Capabilities (MCI with evidence)
    ↓
Applications (NVIDIA, other opportunities)
    ↓
Execution (Deliver results)
    ↓
Documentation (Update MCI, showcase)
    ↓
[Cycle repeats]
```

Each cycle builds proof and credibility for the next.
