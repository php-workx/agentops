# Knowledge Extraction Workflows

**Purpose:** Capture insights, document patterns, and update canonical philosophy.

**Philosophy:** Wisdom is telemetry with empathy attached.

---

## Overview

These workflows guide the extraction and documentation of learnings:

1. **codex-update-workflow.md** - Updating canonical philosophy (Source v2.0)
2. **session-logging-workflow.md** - Capturing session learnings and patterns

---

## When to Use Each Workflow

| Workflow | Use When | Time | Agent |
|----------|----------|------|-------|
| **codex-update-workflow** | Breakthroughs, quarterly philosophy updates | 30-45m | philosophy-documenter |
| **session-logging-workflow** | After sessions, weekly reflections | 10-20m | oracle-morpheus-orchestrator |

## The Knowledge Extraction Pattern

```
Experience (Forge phase)
    ↓
Reflection (Guide phase)
    ↓
Pattern Extraction (What repeats? What matters?)
    ↓
Documentation (Session logs, Codex updates)
    ↓
Teaching (Catalyst phase - share learnings)
    ↓
[Cycle repeats with deeper wisdom]
```

---

## Integration with Construct Cycle

**Forge phase (Weeks 1-3):** Collect experiences
- Work generates raw material
- Friction points noted
- Surprises documented
- Questions captured

**Guide phase (Week 4):** Extract patterns
- Use codex-update-workflow for breakthroughs
- Use session-logging-workflow for regular documentation
- What repeated? What broke? What surprised?

**Catalyst phase (Week 5):** Share learnings
- Teachings prepared from extracted knowledge
- LinkedIn posts based on documented patterns
- Mentorship grounded in codified wisdom

**Resonance phase (Week 6):** Integration
- Patterns settle and connect
- Philosophy deepens
- Wisdom compounds

---

## Success Metrics

**Weekly:** Session logs capture learnings (10-20 min/session)
**Monthly:** 3-5 patterns documented
**Quarterly:** Philosophy updated with breakthroughs
**Yearly:** Codex evolution measurable and documented

**Experience without reflection is just noise. Reflection without documentation is lost wisdom.**
