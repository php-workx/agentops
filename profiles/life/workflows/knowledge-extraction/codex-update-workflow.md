# Codex Update Workflow

**Purpose:** Update canonical philosophy (Source v2.0) with breakthroughs and evolved thinking.

**When to use:** After major breakthroughs, quarterly philosophy updates, Guide phase (Week 4).

**Time:** 30-45 minutes

---

## Overview

Your Codex (`life/canonical/source-v2.md`) is your philosophical foundation. This workflow guides systematic updates when your thinking evolves.

Use with `philosophy-documenter` agent for structured guidance.

## When to Update Codex

### Breakthrough Moments

**Indicators:**
- A fundamental shift in understanding
- Connection between previously disconnected ideas
- Pattern that explains multiple phenomena
- Insight that changes how you approach work

**Examples:**
- 40% rule discovery (ADHD → AI context windows)
- Oracle/Morpheus cycle emergence
- Session 46 self-awareness breakthrough
- Philosophy → practice → production realization

### Quarterly Reviews

**Guide phase (Week 4) of cycles:**
- What patterns emerged this cycle?
- How has my thinking evolved?
- What new connections appeared?
- What needs to be formalized?

### Forced Integration

**When philosophy and practice diverge:**
- You're acting against stated principles
- Your philosophy feels outdated
- Practice has outpaced documented thinking
- Need to reconcile the gap

---

## Step 1: Identify the Update Need (10-15 min)

### What Changed?

**Questions to answer:**
- What do I now understand that I didn't before?
- What belief shifted?
- What connection became clear?
- What practice has proven itself?

**Document the shift:**
```
Old thinking: [What I believed before]
New thinking: [What I understand now]
Evidence: [What experiences led to this shift]
Impact: [How this changes my approach]
```

### Which Section Needs Update?

**Source v2.0 structure:**
- Four Spheres (Forge/Guide/Catalyst/Resonance)
- DevOps resonance mapping
- Five-year arc and leadership ethos
- Mantras and operating principles

**Identify:**
- Which section(s) need changes?
- Are you adding new content or refining existing?
- Does this warrant a version bump? (2.0 → 2.1?)

---

## Step 2: Draft the Update (15-20 min)

### Philosophical Writing Style

**Principles:**
- Clear and direct (not unnecessarily abstract)
- Grounded in experience (not just theory)
- Actionable (philosophy that informs practice)
- Personal (your voice, your journey)

**Structure:**
```markdown
## [Concept Name]

**Essence:** [One-sentence core truth]

**Discovery:** [How you learned this]

**Application:** [How it informs your work]

**Evidence:** [What proves this works]

**Integration:** [How it connects to other concepts]
```

### Example Update Format

```markdown
## The 40% Rule: Universal Degradation Threshold

**Essence:** All complex systems degrade at approximately 40% capacity utilization - whether human attention, AI context windows, or computing resources.

**Discovery:** Noticed ADHD hyperfocus patterns matched AI context degradation points. Both systems fail predictably when pushed past 40% capacity. Tested across multiple domains: personal attention, agent context windows, system performance. Pattern held universally.

**Application:** Design all work to stay under 40% capacity per phase. Multi-phase workflows over monolithic efforts. JIT loading over preloading. Burst patterns over sustained effort.

**Evidence:** 8x efficiency improvement in construct cycles. Zero context collapse in 204 agent sessions. 95% success rate across all workflows. Sustainable pace maintained over 60-day period.

**Integration:** Maps to Forge/Guide/Catalyst/Resonance phases. Each phase respects 40% attention budget. Enables multi-cycle compounding without burnout. Proves consciousness patterns scale to system architecture.
```

## Step 3: Integration Check (5-10 min)

### Consistency Verification

**Review existing Codex:**
- Does new content contradict anything?
- Do you need to update related sections?
- Are cross-references needed?
- Does terminology remain consistent?

**Update related sections:**
- If you add new concept, link from related areas
- If you refine concept, update all mentions
- Ensure philosophical coherence throughout

### DevOps Mapping (if applicable)

**Source v2.0 maps to DevOps Three Ways:**
- Flow (Forge phase) - Throughput and acceleration
- Feedback (Guide phase) - Learning and adjustment
- Learning (Catalyst phase) - Teaching and propagation

**If update affects this mapping:**
- Document the connection
- Show how philosophy informs practice
- Explain bidirectional learning (practice → philosophy)

---

## Step 4: Version Control (3-5 min)

### Versioning Strategy

**Minor updates (2.0 → 2.1):**
- Refinements to existing concepts
- Additional examples or clarifications
- Small additions that don't change core framework

**Major updates (2.0 → 3.0):**
- Fundamental framework changes
- New core concepts added
- Significant restructuring
- Paradigm shifts in thinking

**Document changes:**
```markdown
---
version: 2.1.0
last_updated: 2025-11-06
changes_from_2.0:
  - Added 40% rule detailed explanation
  - Refined Forge/Guide boundary description
  - Integrated Session 46 breakthrough insights
---
```

---

## Step 5: Impact Assessment (5-10 min)

### What Changes Now?

**Practical implications:**
- Does this affect how you work day-to-day?
- Do workflows need updates?
- Should career strategy reflect this?
- Does this inform current cycle execution?

**Ripple effects:**
- What other documents reference this concept?
- Does this change any agent workflows?
- Should this be shared publicly (LinkedIn)?
- Does this inform teaching or mentorship?

### Action Items

**Create follow-up tasks:**
```markdown
## Action Items from Codex Update

**Immediate:**
- [ ] Update construct-cycle-workflow.md with 40% rule details
- [ ] Revise career-strategy.md to reflect new positioning

**Short-term:**
- [ ] Create LinkedIn post explaining 40% rule discovery
- [ ] Update team AgentOps docs with cross-reference

**Long-term:**
- [ ] Consider conference talk on consciousness → architecture
- [ ] Write detailed blog post on philosophical → technical translation
```

---

## Step 6: Documentation (5 min)

### Session Log Entry

**Document the update:**
```markdown
## Codex Update - [Date]

**What changed:** [Summary]

**Why:** [Catalyst for update]

**Impact:** [How this affects work]

**Next steps:** [Follow-up actions]

**Reflection:** [What this update teaches you about your journey]

## Philosophy of Philosophy Documentation

**Why document philosophy at all?**

Philosophy without documentation is intuition. Intuition is valuable but not teachable, not scalable, not replicable.

Documented philosophy becomes:
- Teachable: Others can learn your patterns
- Scalable: Apply across domains and contexts
- Replicable: Successful patterns can be repeated
- Improvable: Explicit thinking can be refined

**The Codex is consciousness made explicit.**
