# Visibility Campaign Workflow

**Purpose:** Build professional presence and LinkedIn visibility strategically.

**Philosophy:** "You don't chase visibility—you instrument it."

**Time:** 15-30 minutes per post, sustained campaign over weeks/months

---

## Overview

This workflow guides systematic LinkedIn visibility building during Catalyst phases. Use with `linkedin-content-creator` agent for content generation.

## The Visibility Strategy

### Core Principle

**Build → Prove → Teach → Scale**

1. **Build:** Do real technical work (Forge phase)
2. **Prove:** Document outcomes with metrics (Guide phase)
3. **Teach:** Share learnings publicly (Catalyst phase)
4. **Scale:** Visibility compounds, opportunities emerge (Resonance)

**Never fake it. Share what you've actually built and learned.**

---

## Step 1: Campaign Planning (10-15 min)

### Define Campaign Theme

**Examples:**
- AgentOps 40x speedup proof
- Platform engineering patterns
- GitOps best practices
- Career transition journey
- AI infrastructure insights

**Your theme should:**
- Align with career goals (NVIDIA positioning)
- Draw from real experience (authenticity)
- Provide value to audience (not just self-promotion)
- Be sustainable (you can write about this for weeks/months)

### Set Campaign Goals

**Visibility metrics:**
- Connections: Target +50-100 per campaign
- Engagement: 100+ reactions per post (top posts)
- Profile views: 2-3x increase
- Inbound interest: DMs, connection requests, opportunities

**Time commitment:**
- 2-3 posts per week (Catalyst phase)
- 15-30 min per post creation
- 10-15 min daily engagement (comments, shares)
- **Total:** 2-3 hours per week during Catalyst

**40% rule check:** Does this fit sustainable pace?

## Step 2: Content Planning (15-20 min)

### Content Categories (80/20 Rule)

**80% Value Content:**
- Technical insights and patterns
- Problem-solving case studies
- Lessons learned
- How-to guides
- Industry observations

**20% Personal/Career Content:**
- Career journey stories
- Breakthrough moments
- Professional milestones
- Personal philosophy
- Reflections and growth

### Post Types

**Technical Deep-Dives (High engagement):**
- Problem → Approach → Solution → Learning
- Include code snippets or architecture diagrams
- Quantify impact where possible
- ~300-500 words

**Pattern Posts (Thought leadership):**
- Observation → Analysis → Principle → Application
- Connect to broader industry trends
- Reference your experience
- ~200-400 words

**Story Posts (Relatability):**
- Challenge → Journey → Outcome → Lesson
- Personal and authentic
- Vulnerable where appropriate
- ~150-300 words

**Quick Tips (Frequent, high reach):**
- Single actionable insight
- Bullet format or short paragraph
- Easy to consume and share
- ~100-200 words

### Content Calendar

**Week 1 (Catalyst Phase):**
- Monday: Technical deep-dive from Forge work
- Wednesday: Quick tip or pattern observation
- Friday: Story post with lesson learned

**Week 2:**
- Monday: Problem-solving case study
- Wednesday: Quick tip from weekly work
- Friday: Reflection or career insight

**Adapt to your rhythm. Consistency > perfection.**

## Step 3: Post Creation (15-30 min per post)

### Hook (First 2 Lines)

**Purpose:** Stop the scroll

**Patterns:**
- Problem statement: "Your Kubernetes pods are crashing, and you don't know why."
- Bold claim: "40x faster isn't hyperbole. Here's the proof."
- Relatable moment: "I spent 10 hours debugging. Turns out the fix was one line."
- Question: "Why do platform engineering teams struggle with GitOps adoption?"

**Test:** Would you keep reading after first 2 lines?

### Body (Main Content)

**Structure:**
```
Hook (2 lines)

Context (What/Why)
- Set the scene
- Explain the problem or topic

Insight (How)
- Your approach
- What you learned
- What worked/didn't

Value (So What)
- Actionable takeaway
- Principle or pattern
- How to apply

Call to Action
- Question or discussion prompt
- Connection invitation if relevant
```

**Length:** 200-500 words optimal (LinkedIn algorithm favors 200-1000)

### Formatting

**Make it scannable:**
- Short paragraphs (2-3 lines max)
- Blank lines between sections
- Bullet points for lists
- Bold for key phrases (sparingly)
- Emojis for section breaks (optional, authentic only)

**Example:**
```
Hook: Platform teams waste 40% of their time on config drift.

Here's why:

Traditional config management = manual, error-prone, reactive.

We solved this with GitOps + deterministic rendering:

• Single source of truth (Git)
• Automated validation (CI/CD)
• Self-healing pipelines (Harmonize)
• Drift detection (ArgoCD)

Result: Config drift dropped to near-zero.

The pattern: Treat config like code. Test it. Version it. Automate it.

## Step 4: Publishing & Engagement (10-15 min)

### Best Times to Post

**LinkedIn patterns:**
- **Tuesday-Thursday:** Highest engagement
- **8-10 AM, 12-2 PM, 5-6 PM:** Peak activity (EST)
- **Avoid:** Late nights, weekends (lower reach)

**Your pattern:** Test and track what works for your network

### Engagement Strategy

**First Hour (Critical):**
- Respond to every comment (algorithm boost)
- Ask follow-up questions
- Thank people for engaging
- Keep conversation going

**Ongoing:**
- Check 2-3 times over 24 hours
- Continue responding to comments
- Share insights from discussion
- Connect with thoughtful commenters

**Be genuine. People can tell when you're just farming engagement.**

---

## Step 5: Amplification (10-15 min)

### Engage with Others

**Daily engagement (10-15 min):**
- Comment thoughtfully on 5-10 posts in your feed
- Share valuable posts with your commentary
- Answer questions in your domain
- Connect with interesting people

**Why this matters:**
- Algorithm favors active users
- Builds relationships
- Increases your visibility
- Establishes expertise through comments

**Pattern:** Give before you ask. Provide value consistently.

### Strategic Connections

**Who to connect with:**
- Platform engineers and architects
- NVIDIA employees (target company)
- Conference speakers and authors
- Open-source contributors in your stack
- Recruiters at target companies

**Connection request message:**
```
Hi [Name],

I've been following your work on [specific topic]. Your post about [specific thing] really resonated.

I'm a platform engineer focused on [your domain], and I'd love to connect and learn from your experience.

Thanks!
[Your Name]
```

**Keep it personal, specific, and brief.**

---

## Step 6: Metrics & Iteration (5-10 min weekly)

### Track Performance

**Per post:**
- Reactions (likes, celebrates, etc.)
- Comments (discussion depth)
- Shares (reach amplification)
- Profile views spike (attribution)

**Overall campaign:**
- Connection growth (+X per week)
- Follower growth
- Engagement rate (reactions per post / connections)
- Inbound opportunities (DMs, messages)

### Learn and Adapt

**Weekly review:**
- What posts performed best? Why?
- What topics resonated?
- What format worked?
- What timing was optimal?

**Adjust:**
- Double down on what works
- Experiment with underperforming areas
- Test new formats or topics
- Refine your voice

- Growing network expands opportunities

**Pattern:** LinkedIn is living MCI

### Knowledge Extraction → Visibility

**Documented learnings become posts:**
- Session logs provide content ideas
- Codex updates become thought leadership
- Patterns discovered become teaching topics

**Pattern:** Document first, teach second

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Posting Without Building

**Problem:** Nothing to share because not doing real work
**Solution:** Build first (Forge), then share (Catalyst)

### Pitfall 2: Inconsistency

**Problem:** Post 5 times one week, then disappear
**Solution:** Sustainable cadence (2-3x per week during Catalyst)

### Pitfall 3: Self-Promotion Only

**Problem:** Every post is "look at me"
**Solution:** 80% value, 20% personal. Teach, don't brag.

### Pitfall 4: Ignoring Engagement

**Problem:** Post and ghost (no comment responses)
**Solution:** First hour engagement is critical. Respond to every comment.

## The Visibility Philosophy

**From the Construct Cycle:**

Visibility isn't separate from work—it's the exhaust of work.

- **Forge:** Build real capability (substance)
- **Guide:** Extract real insights (wisdom)
- **Catalyst:** Share real value (visibility)
- **Resonance:** Integrate and rest (sustainability)

**You're not a marketer. You're a builder who teaches.**

The visibility is a side effect of building well, learning deeply, and sharing generously.
