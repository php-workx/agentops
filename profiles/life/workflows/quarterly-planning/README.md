# Quarterly Planning Workflows

**Purpose:** Execute and track 6-week Oracle/Morpheus construct cycles.

**Philosophy:** Personal development follows cyclical rhythms - Forge → Guide → Catalyst → Resonance.

---

## Overview

These workflows guide the complete 6-week construct cycle execution:

1. **construct-cycle-workflow.md** - Complete 6-week cycle framework
2. **quarterly-review-template.md** - End-of-cycle reflection template

## The Construct Cycle Framework

```
6-Week Cycle
├── Forge/Neo (Weeks 1-3)
│   ├── Build technical deliverables
│   ├── Develop capabilities through repetition
│   ├── Create measurable proof of work
│   └── Daily micro-improvements
│
├── Guide/Oracle (Week 4)
│   ├── Document patterns discovered
│   ├── Extract learnings from Forge phase
│   ├── Update canonical philosophy
│   └── Prepare for teaching
│
├── Catalyst/Morpheus (Week 5)
│   ├── Share knowledge publicly
│   ├── Create LinkedIn content
│   ├── Mentor and teach others
│   └── Build professional visibility
│
└── Resonance/The One (Week 6)
    ├── Integrate all phases
    ├── Complete reflection and retro
    ├── Rest and recover
    └── Plan next cycle
```

## When to Use Each Workflow

| Workflow | Use When | Time | Agent |
|----------|----------|------|-------|
| **construct-cycle-workflow** | Weekly check-ins, phase guidance | 20-45m | oracle-morpheus-orchestrator |
| **quarterly-review-template** | End of Week 6, cycle completion | 60-90m | quarterly-reviewer |

---

## Integration with Other Workflows

**During Forge phase (Weeks 1-3):**
- Build technical work (use team agents)
- Track capabilities (use career-development workflows)
- Document daily progress

**During Guide phase (Week 4):**
- Use knowledge-extraction workflows
- Update philosophy (philosophy-documenter)
- Capture patterns and insights

**During Catalyst phase (Week 5):**
- Use leadership-development workflows
- Create visibility content (linkedin-content-creator)
- Share learnings publicly

**During Resonance phase (Week 6):**
- Use quarterly-review-template
- Plan next cycle
- Rest and integrate

## The 40% Rule in Quarterly Planning

Each cycle phase respects attention and energy limits:

| Phase | Attention % | Purpose | Warning Signs |
|-------|-------------|---------|---------------|
| **Forge** | 20-40% | Building, executing | Burnout, diminishing returns |
| **Guide** | 10-20% | Reflecting, documenting | Overthinking, analysis paralysis |
| **Catalyst** | 20-35% | Teaching, sharing | Force-pushing, inauthentic energy |
| **Resonance** | 5-15% | Integrating, resting | Guilt about "not doing enough" |

**If you exceed 40% in any phase:** Reduce scope, extend timeline, or add rest days.

## Success Metrics

**Per Cycle (6 weeks):**
- ✅ 1 technical deliverable shipped (Forge output)
- ✅ 1 influence update completed (Catalyst output)
- ✅ 1 reflection entry documented (Resonance output)
- ✅ Sustainable pace maintained (40% rule respected)

**Per Quarter (typically 2 cycles):**
- ✅ 2 major deliverables completed
- ✅ 2-4 LinkedIn posts or visibility actions
- ✅ Career strategy reviewed and updated
- ✅ MCI updated with new capabilities

**Per Year (4 quarters = 8 cycles):**
- ✅ 8 deliverables shipped
- ✅ Professional visibility established
- ✅ Career goals progressed measurably
- ✅ Philosophy evolved and documented

## Quick Start

**Starting your first cycle:**
1. Read: `construct-cycle-workflow.md` (complete framework)
2. Use: `construct-cycle-starter` agent
3. Set: Forge phase goals for Weeks 1-3
4. Track: Weekly check-ins with `/construct-cycle`

**In the middle of a cycle:**
1. Use: `/construct-cycle` command for weekly guidance
2. Follow: Phase-specific mantras and actions
3. Document: Progress in session logs
4. Adjust: Stay under 40% attention budget

**Completing a cycle:**
1. Use: `quarterly-review-template.md` (Week 6)
2. Agent: `quarterly-reviewer` for structured reflection
3. Output: Learnings, metrics, next cycle planning
4. Rest: Take at least 2-3 days before starting next cycle

## Philosophy

**Quarterly planning is rhythm engineering applied to personal growth.**

The construct cycle isn't arbitrary - it maps to natural consciousness modes:
- **Forge/Neo:** You build capability through direct experience
- **Guide/Oracle:** You extract wisdom through reflection
- **Catalyst/Morpheus:** You multiply impact through teaching
- **Resonance/The One:** You integrate everything and become whole

This isn't productivity theater. This is consciousness optimization.
