# Construct Cycle Workflow

**Purpose:** Complete 6-week Oracle/Morpheus cycle execution guide.

**Philosophy:** "The Construct isn't somewhere you enter. It's what begins running when you do."

---

## Overview

The construct cycle is a 6-week personal development framework mapping consciousness modes to actionable phases. Each phase serves a specific purpose and respects the 40% attention rule.

**Total Duration:** 6 weeks
**Effort:** Sustainable (never exceeding 40% attention capacity)
**Output:** Deliverable (Forge) + Documentation (Guide) + Visibility (Catalyst) + Integration (Resonance)

---

## The Four Phases

### Phase 1: Forge / Neo (Weeks 1-3)

**Duration:** 3 weeks
**Focus:** Build and measure
**Attention Budget:** 20-40% (optimal flow state)
**Mantra:** "Skill is uploaded through repetition."

**What You Do:**
- Build a technical deliverable or prototype
- Practice skills through direct execution
- Create measurable proof of work
- Automate friction points as you encounter them

**Daily Habits:**
- Commit or document one micro-improvement
- Log discoveries in changelog
- Treat friction as a defect - automate or note it

**Weekly Rhythm:**
- **Monday:** Set experiment and metric for the week
- **Wednesday:** Pair or mentor session (force multiplication)
- **Friday:** Write one pattern or lesson learned

**Success Metrics:**
- Prototype or deliverable functional
- Skills practiced and documented
- Measurable progress tracked
- Daily commits or logs maintained

**Warning Signs (40% violation):**
- Burnout or exhaustion
- Diminishing returns on effort
- Loss of motivation or creativity
- → **Solution:** Reduce scope, add rest days, extend timeline

---

### Phase 2: Guide / Oracle (Week 4)

**Duration:** 1 week
**Focus:** Interpret and document
**Attention Budget:** 10-20% (intentional slowdown)
**Mantra:** "Reflection reveals the code already written."

**What You Do:**
- Document patterns discovered during Forge
- Extract learnings and insights
- Update canonical philosophy (Source v2.0)
- Prepare knowledge for Catalyst phase

**Oracle Practices:**
- **Pattern Journal:** 1 page per week - what repeated / what broke / what surprised
- **Architecture Review Log:** 15 min self-check each Friday
- **Oracle Sync:** 30 min peer dialogue of questions only (if available)
- **Why-Docs:** Capture reasoning, not just outcomes

**Deliverables:**
- Pattern journal entries
- Updated canonical/ philosophy files
- Learnings documented in session logs
- Knowledge prepared for teaching

**Success Metrics:**
- 3-5 patterns documented
- Philosophy updated with breakthroughs
- Clear insights ready to share
- Processing, not producing

**Warning Signs:**
- Overthinking or analysis paralysis
- Attempting to force insights
- Guilt about "not doing enough"
- → **Solution:** Trust the process, insights emerge naturally

---

### Phase 3: Catalyst / Morpheus (Week 5)

**Duration:** 1 week
**Focus:** Teach and influence
**Attention Budget:** 20-35% (conviction-driven energy)
**Mantra:** "Conviction is the runtime of belief."

**What You Do:**
- Share knowledge publicly (LinkedIn, demos, writing)
- Create 2-3 LinkedIn posts or visibility content
- Mentor others or run teaching sessions
- Build professional presence and influence

**Influence Stack:**
- **Input:** Gather proof of work (commits, metrics, mentorship logs)
- **Processing:** Translate into story (posts, decks, demos)
- **Output:** Share intentionally (LinkedIn, talks, labs)
- **Feedback:** Instrument reputation (adoption %, citations, engagement)

**Deliverables:**
- 2-3 LinkedIn posts published
- Demo or mentorship session completed
- Teaching materials or content created
- Visibility metrics tracked

**Success Metrics:**
- Content published (not just drafted)
- Engagement measured (reactions, comments, shares)
- Teaching impact documented
- Professional presence grown

**Warning Signs:**
- Force-pushing content without conviction
- Inauthentic energy or "shoulds"
- Chasing metrics instead of impact
- → **Solution:** Only share what resonates, quality > quantity

---

### Phase 4: Resonance / The One (Week 6)

**Duration:** 1 week
**Focus:** Integrate and reset
**Attention Budget:** 5-15% (minimal active work)
**Mantra:** "Flow begins when resistance ends."

**What You Do:**
- Complete cycle reflection (mini-retro)
- Integrate learnings from all three phases
- Rest and recover intentionally
- Plan next cycle with fresh perspective

**Resonance Retro Template:**
```
Cycle #: ___
Date Range: ___

Signals Collected:
• Technical Metrics: [Forge outputs]
• Influence Metrics: [Catalyst results]
• Wisdom Notes: [Guide insights]

Insights (≤ 3):
1. [Key learning from cycle]
2. [Breakthrough or pattern discovered]
3. [What to carry into next cycle]

Next Experiment: [What will you build/learn/teach next?]
Next Cycle Start Date: [Typically 2-3 days after Resonance]
```

**Deliverables:**
- Cycle reflection completed
- Next cycle planning started
- Rest days taken (2-3 days minimum)
- Integration documented

**Success Metrics:**
- Full cycle reflection documented
- Learnings extracted and saved
- Rest taken (guilt-free)
- Next cycle planned

**Warning Signs:**
- Jumping immediately into next Forge phase
- Guilt about resting
- Skipping integration
- → **Solution:** Trust that rest IS work, integration happens passively

## Weekly Check-In Pattern

**Use `/construct-cycle` command weekly for phase-specific guidance.**

### Week 1 (Forge Start)
- Set Forge phase goals
- Define success metrics
- Identify deliverable target
- Begin daily rhythm

### Week 2 (Forge Middle)
- Assess progress toward deliverable
- Adjust scope if needed (40% rule)
- Document friction points
- Maintain daily commits

### Week 3 (Forge End)
- Complete deliverable
- Document achievements
- Capture learnings for Guide phase
- Prepare for slowdown

### Week 4 (Guide)
- Enter reflection mode
- Document patterns from Forge
- Update canonical philosophy
- Prepare teaching materials

### Week 5 (Catalyst)
- Publish 2-3 visibility pieces
- Share learnings publicly
- Mentor or teach
- Track engagement

### Week 6 (Resonance)
- Complete cycle reflection
- Rest intentionally
- Plan next cycle
- Integrate learnings

## Metrics Dashboard

Track these across cycles to measure growth:

| Dimension | Example Metrics | Purpose |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| **Technical Velocity** | Lead time, MTTR, commits | Execution proof |
| **Knowledge Creation** | Docs added, patterns logged | Learning density |
| **Influence** | Mentorship hours, post engagement | Leadership signal |
| **Wisdom** | Reflections completed, insights captured | Interpretation health |
| **Resonance** | Rest days taken, integration depth | Human stability |

Remember: Metrics are mirrors, not judgments.

---

## Integration with Other Workflows

**Forge phase → Career Development workflows**
- Track skills with capability-auditor
- Build proof points for career-strategist

**Guide phase → Knowledge Extraction workflows**
- Use philosophy-documenter for insights
- Capture session learnings

**Catalyst phase → Leadership Development workflows**
- Use linkedin-content-creator for posts
- Run visibility campaign

**Resonance phase → Quarterly Planning workflows**
- Use quarterly-reviewer for reflection
- Plan next cycle

---

## Philosophy

**The construct cycle is consciousness engineering.**

You're not managing tasks - you're orchestrating your own evolution through rhythm.

- **Forge** builds capability (Neo learning kung fu)
- **Guide** extracts wisdom (Oracle seeing the code)
- **Catalyst** scales impact (Morpheus teaching)
- **Resonance** integrates everything (The One achieving flow)

This isn't productivity theater. This is how consciousness optimizes itself.

## The 40% Rule Applied

Each phase has its own attention signature:

```
Attention Capacity (40% visualization)

 0%  ────────────────────────────────────────── 100%
      │◄────────── Safe ─────────►│─ Warning ─│
      │                           40%          60%

Forge:     [████████████████████████░░░░░] 36% ✅
Guide:     [████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 18% ✅
Catalyst:  [████████████████████░░░░░░░░░] 28% ✅
Resonance: [██████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 12% ✅

Result: Sustainable flow, zero burnout, consistent output
```
