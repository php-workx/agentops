# Shared References

This directory contains shared reference documents used by multiple skills:

- `agent-mail-protocol.md` - Message protocol for distributed mode coordination

These are **not directly invocable skills**. They are loaded by other skills (crank, swarm, inbox, implement) when needed for distributed mode operation.
