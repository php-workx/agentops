# Plan Skill

Create reusable formula templates (.formula.toml) that define structured implementation
patterns. Formulas produce beads issues with proper dependencies and wave computation
for parallel execution.

## Role in the Brownian Ratchet

Formulas are **captured ratchet patterns** - proven solutions that can be reused:

| Component | Formula's Role |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Chaos** | Formula development: multiple attempts to find right structure |
| **Filter** | Successful patterns captured, failed patterns discarded |
| **Ratchet** | `.formula.toml` locks the pattern for reuse |

> **A formula is a ratcheted solution that prevents re-solving the same problem.**

Once a formula works (validated by /crank execution), it becomes a reusable
template. Future work with similar structure instantiates the formula instead
of planning from scratch.

**Formula Hierarchy:**
```
Research → Plan → Implement → Validate → FORMULA (captured pattern)
                                              ↓
                              Future work: cook → pour → execute
```

## Overview

**Core Purpose**: Transform a goal into a reusable formula template (.formula.toml) that
captures the pattern for creating beads issues with dependency ordering and wave-based
parallelization for `/crank` (autonomous) or `/implement-wave` (supervised).

**Key Capabilities**:
- 6-tier context discovery hierarchy
- Prior formula discovery to prevent duplicates
- Feature decomposition with dependency modeling
- Formula template creation with proper TOML structure
- Auto-instantiation via `bd cook`
- Beads issue creation with epic-child relationships
- Wave computation for parallel execution

**Formulas vs Plans**:
- **Formula**: Reusable template (.formula.toml) - can be instantiated multiple times
- **Plan**: One-time execution plan - specific to a single goal

**When to Use**: Work needs 2+ discrete issues with dependencies, or a reusable pattern is desired.
**When NOT to Use**: Single task (use `/implement`), exploratory (use `/research`).

### Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--immediate` | Skip formula creation, directly create beads issues |
| `--cook` | Auto-run `bd cook` after formula creation |
| `--dry-run` | Preview formula output without writing files |

---

## Instructions

### Setup

```bash
mkdir -p .agents/formulas/
```

---

### Phase 1: Context Discovery

See `~/.claude/skills/research/references/context-discovery.md` for full 6-tier hierarchy.

**Quick version**: Code-Map -> Semantic Search -> Scoped Grep -> Source -> .agents/ -> External

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Checked code-map index
- [ ] Ran semantic search (if MCP available)
- [ ] Followed signposts to source
- [ ] Reviewed .agents/ patterns WITH verification

---

### Phase 1.3: Prior Research Discovery

Before exploring from scratch, check if research already exists:

```bash
# Priority 1: Query ao CLI (searches all indexed knowledge)
ao forge search "<goal>" --limit 10

# Priority 2: Semantic search via MCP (if ao unavailable)
mcp__smart-connections-work__lookup(query="<goal>", limit=5)
# Filter results to .agents/research/ and .agents/synthesis/ paths

# Priority 3: File-based fallback (if both unavailable)
ls .agents/research/*.md .agents/synthesis/*.md 2>/dev/null | head -10
grep -l "<goal keywords>" .agents/research/*.md .agents/synthesis/*.md 2>/dev/null
```

| Prior Research Status | Action |
|-----------------------|--------|
| **EXISTS + RELEVANT** | Use as context, skip Phase 2 exploration |
| **EXISTS + PARTIAL** | Build on it, targeted Phase 2 exploration |
| **NONE** | Full Phase 2 exploration |

**Key insight**: If `/research` was already run, don't re-explore. Build on existing artifacts.

**Unified approach**: Both `/research` and `/plan` use the same discovery priority:
`ao forge search` → MCP semantic → grep fallback. This ensures consistent knowledge retrieval.

---

### Phase 1.5: Prior Formula Discovery

Before creating new formulas, check for existing work:

```bash
# Town-level formulas (Mayor/orchestration work)
grep -l "<goal keywords>" .agents/formulas/*.toml 2>/dev/null | head -5
grep -l "<goal keywords>" .agents/formulas/*.toml 2>/dev/null | head -5

# Crew workspace formulas (implementation work - may have older artifacts)
grep -l "<goal keywords>" ./crew/<user>/.agents/formulas/*.toml 2>/dev/null | head -5
grep -l "<goal keywords>" ./crew/<user>/.beads/formulas/*.toml 2>/dev/null | head -5

# Existing beads epics
bd list --type=epic | grep -i "<goal keywords>"
```

**Note**: Prior formulas may exist in either location:
- **Town-level** (`.agents/formulas/`) - Mayor/orchestration formulas
- **Crew workspace** (`./crew/<user>/.agents/formulas/`) - Implementation formulas

| Prior Formula Status | Action |
|----------------------|--------|
| EXISTS | Reference it, instantiate instead of creating new |
| SIMILAR | Extend existing formula or create variant |
| NONE | Create new formula |

---

### Phase 2: Research/Analysis

Deepen understanding with targeted exploration:

```
Task(
    subagent_type="Explore",
    model="haiku",
    prompt="Find all code related to: $GOAL"
)
```

**Model**: Use `haiku` for exploration (fast, cheap).

**Identify**: Affected files, existing patterns, related tests, blockers.

---

### Phase 3: Decompose into Features

Each feature should be:
- Completable in a single focused session
- Testable independently
- Following existing patterns

#### Dependency Direction (CRITICAL)

**Rule:** `bd dep add A B` means "A waits for B"

| Command | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `bd dep add A B` | A depends on B (B must complete first) |
| `bd dep add child epic` | **WRONG** - Creates deadlock! |

#### Epic-Child Relationship

**Epics and children have NO dependency relationship.** Track children via comment:

```bash
# 1. Create epic
bd create "Epic: OAuth2 Support" --type epic --priority P1
# -> ai-platform-101

# 2. Create children (NO dependency on epic!)
bd create "Add callback endpoint" --type feature --priority P1
# -> ai-platform-102

# 3. Dependencies ONLY between children
bd dep add ai-platform-103 ai-platform-102

# 4. Track children via comment (NOT dependency!)
bd comments add ai-platform-101 "Children: ai-platform-102, ai-platform-103"
```

#### Wave Computation

| Wave | Rule |
|------|------|
| Wave 1 | Issues with NO dependencies |
| Wave N | Issues where ALL deps are in Wave N-1 or earlier |

---

### Phase 3.5: Verify Agent Dependencies

For agent-related work (KAgents, MCP servers):

```bash
grep -A5 "agents:" charts/ai-platform/values.yaml
ls services/mcp-servers/
```

---

### Phase 4: Create Formula Template

Analyze the decomposed features and prepare the formula structure:

1. **Identify Variables**: Extract parameterizable values (service names, paths, etc.)
2. **Define Steps**: Map each feature to a [[steps]] entry with proper dependencies
3. **Compute Waves**: Group steps by dependency order for parallel execution

---

### Phase 5: Output Formula TOML File

**CRITICAL**: Write the formula to `.agents/formulas/{topic-slug}.formula.toml`

```toml
# Formula: {Goal Name}
# Created: YYYY-MM-DD

# Required top-level fields (NOT in a [formula] table!)
formula = "{topic-slug}"
description = "{Detailed description of what this formula produces}"
version = 2
type = "workflow"  # MUST be: workflow | expansion | aspect

# Optional: Variables for parameterization
# Use {{var_name}} in step descriptions
# Each variable needs its own table with description and optional default
[vars]
[vars.service_name]
description = "Name of the service being created"
default = "default-service"
[vars.base_path]
description = "Base path for service files"
default = "services/"

# Steps become child issues when the formula is poured
[[steps]]
id = "core"
title = "Create core implementation"
description = """
Implement the core {{service_name}} functionality:
- Add main module at {{base_path}}{{service_name}}/core.py
- Include error handling and logging
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
"""
needs = []  # No dependencies - Wave 1

[[steps]]
id = "config"
title = "Add configuration"
description = """
Add configuration for {{service_name}}:
- Update charts/values.yaml with new config section
- Add environment variable mappings
- Document configuration options
"""
needs = []  # No dependencies - Wave 1 (parallel with core)

[[steps]]
id = "tests"
title = "Implement tests"
description = """
Add comprehensive tests for {{service_name}}:
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Ensure >80% coverage
"""
needs = ["core"]  # Depends on core - Wave 2

[[steps]]
id = "docs"
title = "Add documentation"
description = """
Document {{service_name}}:
- API reference in docs/
- Update README with usage examples
- Add architecture decision record if needed
"""
needs = ["core", "config"]  # Depends on both - Wave 2
```

**Formula TOML Structure Reference**:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `formula` | Yes | Unique identifier (slug) - TOP LEVEL string |
| `description` | Yes | What the formula creates |
| `version` | Yes | Integer (use `2`) |
| `type` | Yes | Must be: `workflow`, `expansion`, or `aspect` |
| `[vars.name]` | No | Variable table with `description` and optional `default` |
| `[[steps]]` | Yes | Array of step definitions |
| `steps.id` | Yes | Unique step identifier |
| `steps.title` | Yes | Short step title |
| `steps.description` | Yes | Detailed implementation guidance |
| `steps.needs` | Yes | Array of step IDs this depends on (empty = Wave 1) |

**WRONG format (do NOT use):**
- `[formula]` table with `name = "..."` inside
- `version = "1.0.0"` (string)
- `type = "feature"` (invalid type)
- `[[tasks]]` instead of `[[steps]]`
- `depends_on`, `priority`, `wave`, `files` in steps
- `[vars]\nvar_name = "value"` (must use `[vars.var_name]\ndescription = "..."`)

**Wave Computation from `needs`**:
- Wave 1: Steps with `needs = []`
- Wave N: Steps where all `needs` are in Wave N-1 or earlier

---

### Phase 5.5: Cook and Pour Formula (Optional)

After writing the formula file, use the two-step process to create beads:

**Step 1: Cook** - Transform formula to proto (saves to database)
```bash
# Preview what would be created (dry run)
bd cook .agents/formulas/{topic-slug}.formula.toml --dry-run

# Cook and persist proto to database
bd cook .agents/formulas/{topic-slug}.formula.toml --persist

# With variable substitution
bd cook .agents/formulas/{topic-slug}.formula.toml --persist \
  --var service_name=rate-limiter
```

**Step 2: Pour** - Instantiate proto into active mol (persistent beads)
```bash
# Pour the cooked proto (creates actual issues)
bd mol pour {topic-slug}

# Or with variable overrides
bd mol pour {topic-slug} --var service_name=rate-limiter

# Use wisp for ephemeral work (auto-cleaned)
bd mol wisp {topic-slug} --var service_name=rate-limiter
```

**Alternative: Direct beads creation (--immediate flag)**

For one-off work, skip formula files and create beads directly (see Phase 6).

**Note**: `bd cook --persist` saves the proto to the database. Then `bd mol pour`
creates actual beads issues from that proto.

---

### Phase 6: Instantiate Formula (--immediate or Manual)

**Option A: Using `bd mol pour` (Recommended)**

If `--cook` flag was passed or auto-instantiation is desired:

```bash
# Pour creates persistent beads from the formula proto
bd mol pour {topic-slug}
# Returns: Created mol ai-platform-xxx from proto {topic-slug}
```

**Option B: Using `--immediate` Flag**

When `--immediate` is passed, skip formula file creation entirely and create beads directly:

```bash
# Create epic
bd create "Epic: $GOAL" --type epic --priority P1

# Create features from decomposition
bd create "Feature description" --type feature --priority P2

# Set dependencies
bd dep add ai-platform-103 ai-platform-102

# REQUIRED: File annotations for wave parallelization
bd comment <id> "Files affected: src/auth/middleware.py, tests/test_auth.py"

# Track children on epic
bd comments add ai-platform-100 "Children: ai-platform-101, ai-platform-102, ai-platform-103"

# Start epic
bd update ai-platform-100 --status in_progress
```

**Option C: Manual Instantiation**

For formulas that need customization before instantiation:

```bash
# Edit the formula file to adjust variables
vim .agents/formulas/{topic-slug}.formula.toml

# Preview with cook (outputs JSON proto)
bd cook .agents/formulas/{topic-slug}.formula.toml --mode=runtime

# Then pour to create beads
bd mol pour {topic-slug} --var service_name=custom-name
```

---

### Phase 7: Write Companion Documentation

Create a companion markdown file at `.agents/formulas/{topic-slug}.md` with:
- Frontmatter with date, goal, epic ID, tags
- Features table with dependencies
- Wave execution order table
- Dependency graph (ASCII)
- Crank handoff section

See `references/templates.md` for full template.

---

### Phase 8: Output Summary

Output structured summary with crank handoff:

```markdown
# Formula Complete: [Goal]

**Formula:** `.agents/formulas/{goal-slug}.formula.toml`
**Epic:** `ai-platform-xxx`
**Plan:** `.agents/formulas/{goal-slug}.md`
**Issues:** N features across M waves

## Wave Execution Order
| Wave | Issues | Can Parallel |
|------|--------|--------------|
| 1 | ai-platform-102, ai-platform-106 | Yes |
| 2 | ai-platform-103 | No |

## Ready for Execution

**Autonomous (overnight, parallel via polecats):**
```bash
/crank ai-platform-xxx              # Full auto until epic closed
```

**Supervised (sequential, same session):**
```bash
/implement-wave ai-platform-xxx     # One wave at a time
```
```

---

## Epic Lifecycle Checklist

- [ ] Create epic with `bd create --type epic`
- [ ] Create children (NO dependency on epic!)
- [ ] Add children list to epic via `bd comment`
- [ ] **Start epic**: `bd update <epic> --status in_progress`
- [ ] Implement children via `/implement` or `/implement-wave`
- [ ] **Close epic**: `bd close <epic>` after all children done
- [ ] Run `bd sync && git push` before session end

**Common Gotcha**: Children can't become `ready` until epic is `in_progress`.

---

## Anti-Patterns

| DON'T | DO INSTEAD |
|-------|------------|
| Create children depending on epic | Track via comment on epic |
| Skip file annotations | Add "Files affected: ..." |
| Create 10+ features at once | Group into 3-5 per wave |
| Skip prior formula check | Search .agents/formulas/ first |
| Grep source blindly | Use code-map signposts |
| Forget to start epic | `bd update <epic> --status in_progress` |
| Create one-off plans for repeatable patterns | Create a formula template |

---

**Progressive Disclosure**: This skill provides core formulation workflows. For detailed templates see `references/templates.md`, for examples see `references/examples.md`.

## Phase Completion (RPI Workflow)

When formulation is complete:

```bash
~/.claude/scripts/checkpoint.sh plan "Brief description of formula created"
```

This will:
1. Save a checkpoint to `.agents/checkpoints/`
2. Remind you to start a fresh session
3. Provide recovery commands for the next phase

**Why fresh session?** Planning context (decomposition decisions, patterns explored) can bias
the implementation phase. The RPI workflow enforces clean boundaries between phases.

## Next

```
/plan -> /crank or /implement-wave or /implement
```

After checkpoint, start fresh session and run `/crank <epic>` or `/implement-wave <wave>`.
