# Release Skill

> **Purpose:** Take a project from "code is ready" to "tagged and ready to push."

Pre-flight validation, changelog from git history, version bumps across package files, release commit, annotated tag, and optional draft GitHub Release. Everything is local and reversible. Publishing is CI's job.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
/release 1.7.0                # full release: changelog + bump + commit + tag
/release 1.7.0 --dry-run      # show what would happen, change nothing
/release --check               # readiness validation only (GO/NO-GO)
/release                       # suggest version from commit analysis
/release 2.0.0 --gh-release    # also create draft GitHub Release
```

---

## Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `version` | No | Semver string (e.g., `1.7.0`). If omitted, suggest based on commit analysis |
| `--check` | No | Readiness validation only — don't generate or write anything |
| `--dry-run` | No | Show generated changelog + version bumps without writing |
| `--gh-release` | No | Create a draft GitHub Release with the changelog entry |
| `--skip-checks` | No | Skip pre-flight validation (tests, lint) |
| `--changelog-only` | No | Only update CHANGELOG.md — no version bumps, no commit, no tag |

---

## Modes

### Default: Full Release

`/release [version]` — the complete local release workflow.

Steps: pre-flight → changelog → version bump → user review → write → release commit → tag → optional GitHub Release draft → guidance.

### Check Mode

`/release --check` — standalone readiness validation.

Runs all pre-flight checks and reports GO/NO-GO. Useful before starting the release, in CI as a gate, or composed with `/vibe`. Does not generate or write anything.

### Changelog Only

`/release 1.7.0 --changelog-only` — just update CHANGELOG.md.

Generates the changelog entry and writes it. No version bumps, no commit, no tag.

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Pre-flight

Run these checks before anything else:

```bash
git rev-parse --git-dir           # must be in a git repo
git status --porcelain            # warn if dirty
git branch --show-current         # show current branch
```

**Checks:**

| Check | How | Severity |
|-------|-----|----------|
| Git repo | `git rev-parse --git-dir` | Block — cannot proceed |
| CHANGELOG.md exists | Glob for changelog (case-insensitive) | Offer to create if missing |
| Has `[Unreleased]` section | Read CHANGELOG.md | Warn |
| Working tree clean | `git status --porcelain` | Warn (show dirty files) |
| On expected branch | `git branch --show-current` | Warn if not main/master/release |
| Tests pass | Detect and run test command | Warn (show failures) |
| Lint clean | Detect and run lint command | Warn (show issues) |
| Version consistency | Compare versions across package files | Warn (show mismatches) |
| Commits since last tag | `git log --oneline <range>` | Block if empty — nothing to release |

**Test/lint detection:**

| File | Test Command | Lint Command |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `go.mod` | `go test ./...` | `golangci-lint run` (if installed) |
| `package.json` | `npm test` | `npm run lint` (if script exists) |
| `pyproject.toml` | `pytest` | `ruff check .` (if installed) |
| `Cargo.toml` | `cargo test` | `cargo clippy` (if installed) |
| `Makefile` with `test:` | `make test` | `make lint` (if target exists) |

If `--skip-checks` is passed, skip tests and lint (still check git state and versions).

In `--check` mode, run all checks and output a summary table:

```
Release Readiness: NO-GO

  [PASS] Git repo
  [PASS] CHANGELOG.md exists
  [PASS] Working tree clean
  [WARN] Branch: feature/foo (expected main)
  [FAIL] Tests: 2 failures in auth_test.go
  [PASS] Lint clean
  [PASS] Version consistency (1.6.0 in all 2 files)
  [PASS] 14 commits since v1.6.0
```

In `--check` mode, stop here. In default mode, continue (warnings don't block).

### Step 2: Determine range

Find the last release tag:

```bash
git tag --sort=-version:refname -l 'v*' | head -1
```

- If no `v*` tags exist, use the first commit: `git rev-list --max-parents=0 HEAD`
- The range is `<last-tag>..HEAD`
- If range is empty (no new commits), stop and tell the user

### Step 3: Read git history

Gather commit data for classification:

```bash
git log --oneline --no-merges <range>
git log --format="%H %s" --no-merges <range>
git diff --stat <range>
```

Use `--oneline` for the summary view and full hashes for detail lookups when a commit message is ambiguous.

### Step 4: Classify and group

Classify each commit into one of four categories:

| Category | Signal |
|----------|--------|
| **Added** | New features, new files, "add", "create", "implement", "introduce", `feat` |
| **Changed** | Modifications, updates, refactors, "update", "refactor", "rename", "migrate" |
| **Fixed** | Bug fixes, corrections, "fix", "correct", "resolve", "patch" |
| **Removed** | Deletions, "remove", "delete", "drop", "deprecate" |

**Grouping rules:**

- Group related commits that share a component prefix (e.g., `auth:`, `api:`, `feat(users)`)
- Combine grouped commits into a single bullet with a merged description
- **Match the existing CHANGELOG style** — read the most recent versioned entry and replicate its bullet format, separator style, and heading structure
- If a commit message is ambiguous, read the diff with `git show --stat <hash>` to clarify

**Key rules:**

- **Don't invent** — only document what git log shows
- **Omit empty sections** — don't include `### Removed` if nothing was removed
- **Commits, not diffs** — classify from commit messages; read diffs only when ambiguous
- **Merge-commit subjects are noise** — already filtered by `--no-merges`

### Step 5: Suggest version

If no version was provided, suggest one based on the commit classification:

| Condition | Suggestion |
|-----------|------------|
| Any commit contains "BREAKING", "breaking change", or `!:` (conventional commits) | **Major** bump |
| Any commits classified as Added (new features) | **Minor** bump |
| Only Fixed/Changed commits | **Patch** bump |

Show the suggestion with reasoning:

```
Suggested version: 1.7.0 (minor)
Reason: 3 new features added, no breaking changes

Current version: 1.6.0 (from package.json, go tags)
```

Use AskUserQuestion to confirm or let the user provide a different version.

### Step 6: Generate changelog entry

Produce a markdown block in [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format:

```markdown
## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD

### Added
- description of new feature

### Changed
- description of change

### Fixed
- description of fix
```

Use today's date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

**Style adaptation:** Read the existing CHANGELOG entries and match their conventions:
- Bullet format (plain text vs bold names vs backtick names)
- Separator style (em-dash ` — `, hyphen ` - `, colon `: `)
- Grouping patterns (flat list vs sub-sections)
- Level of detail (terse vs verbose)

If no existing entries to reference (first release), use plain Keep a Changelog defaults.

### Step 7: Detect and offer version bumps

Scan for files containing version strings:

| File | Pattern | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `package.json` | `"version": "X.Y.Z"` | `"version": "1.6.0"` |
| `pyproject.toml` | `version = "X.Y.Z"` | `version = "1.6.0"` |
| `Cargo.toml` | `version = "X.Y.Z"` | `version = "1.6.0"` |
| `*.go` | `const Version = "X.Y.Z"` or `var version = "X.Y.Z"` | `const Version = "1.6.0"` |
| `version.txt` | Plain version string | `1.6.0` |
| `VERSION` | Plain version string | `1.6.0` |
| `.goreleaser.yml` | Version from ldflags (show, don't modify — goreleaser reads from git tags) | — |

Show what was found:

```
Version strings detected:

  package.json:       "version": "1.6.0"  → "1.7.0"
  src/version.go:     const Version = "1.6.0"  → "1.7.0"
  .goreleaser.yml:    (reads from git tag — no change needed)
```

Use AskUserQuestion: "Update these version strings?" — "Yes, update all" / "Let me choose" / "Skip version bumps"

### Step 8: User review

Present everything that will change:

1. The generated changelog entry (fenced markdown block)
2. The version bumps (file-by-file diff preview)
3. What will happen: "Will write CHANGELOG.md, update 2 version files, create release commit, create tag v1.7.0"

If `--dry-run` was passed, stop here.

Use AskUserQuestion:
- "Proceed with this release?"
- Options: "Yes, do it" / "Let me edit the changelog first" / "Abort"

### Step 9: Write changes

After user confirms:

1. **Update CHANGELOG.md:**
   - Find the `## [Unreleased]` line
   - Find where the unreleased section ends (next `## [` line or EOF)
   - Replace with: fresh empty `## [Unreleased]` + blank line + versioned entry
2. **Update version files** (if user accepted bumps)

### Step 10: Release commit

Stage and commit all release changes together:

```bash
git add CHANGELOG.md <version-files...>
git commit -m "Release v<version>"
```

The commit message is intentionally simple. The changelog has the details.

### Step 11: Tag

Create an annotated tag:

```bash
git tag -a v<version> -m "Release v<version>"
```

### Step 12: Draft GitHub Release (optional)

If `--gh-release` was passed and `gh` CLI is available:

```bash
gh release create v<version> --draft --title "v<version>" --notes-file <tmpfile>
```

The notes file contains the generated changelog entry. Draft, not published — the user reviews and publishes.

If `gh` is not available, skip and mention it in guidance.

### Step 13: Post-release guidance

Show the user what to do next:

```
Release v1.7.0 prepared locally.

Next steps:
  git push origin main --tags     # push commit + tag

Your CI will handle: build, validate, publish
  (detected: .github/workflows/release.yml, .goreleaser.yml)
```

If no CI detected:
```
Next steps:
  git push origin main --tags     # push commit + tag
  gh release edit v1.7.0 --draft=false  # publish the GitHub Release

No release CI detected. Consider adding a workflow for automated publishing.
```

### Step 14: Audit trail

Write a release record:

```bash
mkdir -p .agents/releases
```

Write to `.agents/releases/YYYY-MM-DD-v<version>.md`:

```markdown
# Release v<version>

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Previous:** v<previous-version>
**Commits:** N commits in range

## Changelog Entry

<the generated entry>

## Version Bumps

<files updated>

## Pre-flight Results

<check summary table>

## Next Steps

<guidance shown to user>
```

This feeds into the knowledge flywheel and provides a record of what happened.

---

## New Changelog Template

When no `CHANGELOG.md` exists and the user accepts creation, write:

```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
```

Then proceed with the normal workflow to populate the first versioned entry.

## Boundaries

### What this skill does

- Pre-flight validation (tests, lint, clean tree, versions, branch)
- Changelog generation from git history
- Semver suggestion from commit classification
- Version string bumps in package files
- Release commit + annotated tag
- Draft GitHub Release
- Post-release guidance
- Audit trail

### What this skill does NOT do

- **No publishing** — no `npm publish`, `cargo publish`, `twine upload`. CI handles this.
- **No building** — no `go build`, `npm pack`, `docker build`. CI handles this.
- **No pushing** — no `git push`, no `git push --tags`. The user decides when to push.
- **No CI triggering** — the tag push (done by the user) triggers CI.
- **No monorepo multi-version** — one version, one changelog, one tag. Scope for v2.

Everything this skill does is local and reversible:
- Bad changelog → edit the file
- Wrong version bump → `git reset HEAD~1`
- Bad tag → `git tag -d v<version>`
- Draft GitHub Release → delete from the UI

## Universal Rules

- **Don't invent** — only document what git log shows
- **No commit hashes** in the final output
- **No author names** in the final output
- **Concise** — one sentence per bullet, technical but readable
- **Adapt, don't impose** — match the project's existing style rather than forcing a particular format
- **User confirms** — never write without showing the draft first
- **Local only** — never push, publish, or trigger remote actions
