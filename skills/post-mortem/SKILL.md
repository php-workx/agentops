# Post-Mortem Skill

**The RPI capstone: validate + learn + extract + feed back into the flywheel.**

## Role in the Brownian Ratchet

Post-mortem is the **knowledge ratchet** - the final stage that locks learnings:

| Component | Post-Mortem's Role |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Chaos** | Implementation produced outcomes (good and bad) |
| **Filter** | Retro extracts what matters, discards noise |
| **Ratchet** | Learnings locked in `.agents/`, MCP, specs |

> **Learnings never go backward. Once ratcheted, knowledge compounds.**

Post-mortem closes the knowledge loop:
```
Implementation → POST-MORTEM → Ratcheted Knowledge → Next Research
                    │
                    ├── .agents/retros/     (locked)
                    ├── .agents/learnings/  (locked)
                    ├── .agents/patterns/   (locked)
                    └── MCP memories        (locked)
```

**The Flywheel Effect:** Each ratcheted learning makes the next cycle faster.
This is why `/post-mortem` is mandatory - skipping it breaks the compounding.

## Philosophy

> "Implementation isn't done until we've validated it, learned from it, and fed that knowledge back into the system."

Post-mortem is the comprehensive POST phase of RPI that closes the knowledge loop. It combines everything that feeds back into the flywheel:

| Component | Purpose | Flywheel Feed |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| **Retro** | What went wrong/right? | `.agents/retros/`, `.agents/learnings/` |
| **Vibe** | Code quality validation | Issues for findings, quality metrics |
| **Security** | Vulnerability scanning (Talos) | Security posture, CVE tracking |
| **Extract** | Knowledge persistence | MCP memories, `.agents/patterns/` |
| **Spec Update** | Lessons back to source | Enhanced specs for next iteration |

**All roads lead back to Research.** Every output feeds the next cycle.

## Quick Start

```bash
/post-mortem <epic-id>           # Full post-mortem on completed epic
/post-mortem                      # Auto-discover recently completed epic
/post-mortem --skip-security      # Skip security scan (faster)
/post-mortem --update-spec        # Update original spec with lessons
```

## Phase 0: Session-Aware Discovery (Enhanced)

**Problem solved:** The old heuristic (`bd list --since "24 hours ago"`) grabbed the wrong
epic when multiple epics closed recently. The new approach parses session transcripts to
find what was actually worked on.

### Primary: Session Transcript Analysis

```python
# Using the lib/transcript.py module
from lib.transcript import (
    find_session_transcripts,
    parse_transcript,
    extract_epic_from_session,
)
from lib.compaction import find_compaction_chain, build_composite_session

# 1. Find current project's transcripts
transcripts = find_session_transcripts(project_path)

# 2. Parse most recent transcript (handles compaction)
if transcripts:
    chain = find_compaction_chain(transcripts[0])
    session = build_composite_session(chain)
    EPIC = extract_epic_from_session(session)
```

**How it works:**
1. Finds Claude Code transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/{project-path}/`
2. Parses JSONL to extract beads operations (`bd update`, `bd close`)
3. Identifies epic from session work (not just recent closures)
4. Handles compaction chains (work spanning context resets)

### Fallback: Beads Heuristic

Only if session analysis fails (no transcripts, parsing error):

```bash
# Fallback to beads-based discovery
EPIC=$(bd list --type epic --status closed --since "24 hours ago" | head -1 | awk '{print $1}')

if [[ -z "$EPIC" ]]; then
    EPIC=$(bd list --type epic --status in_progress | head -1 | awk '{print $1}')
    OPEN_CHILDREN=$(bd list --parent=$EPIC --status open | wc -l)
    if [[ "$OPEN_CHILDREN" -gt 0 ]]; then
        echo "Epic $EPIC still has $OPEN_CHILDREN open children"
        exit 1
    fi
fi
```

### Gather Changed Files

```bash
# Get all commits from the epic's work
COMMITS=$(git log --oneline --since="7 days ago" --grep="$EPIC" | awk '{print $1}')

# Get changed files
CHANGED_FILES=$(git diff --name-only $COMMITS | sort -u)
```

---

## Phase 0.5: Cross-Compaction Chain (NEW)

**Problem solved:** Work spanning context compactions was lost. Now we merge
all transcript files in the compaction chain.

```python
from lib.compaction import find_compaction_chain, build_composite_session

# Find all related transcripts (same session slug)
chain = find_compaction_chain(transcript_path)

# Merge into unified view
composite = build_composite_session(chain)

# composite now has:
# - All beads operations from before AND after compaction
# - All file changes
# - All commits made
# - Compaction marker locations
```

**Compaction detection markers:**
- "session is being continued"
- "summary below covers"
- "context has been compacted"

---

## Phase 0.6: Root Cause Trace (NEW)

**Problem solved:** Post-mortem only validated code, couldn't trace back to
research/spec/pre-mortem that led to the implementation.

```python
from lib.trace import trace_epic_provenance, format_provenance_report

# Trace full chain from research to result
chain = trace_epic_provenance(
    epic_id=EPIC,
    session=session,
    project_path=project_root,
)

# chain contains:
# - research_artifact: .agents/research/*.md
# - product_brief: .agents/products/*.md
# - pre_mortem_results: .claude/plans/*-agent*.md
# - spec_artifact: .formula.toml or .agents/specs/*.md
# - plan_artifact: .claude/plans/*.md
# - implementation_commits: git commits
# - decisions_made: extracted from session
```

**Include in report:**
```python
provenance_section = format_provenance_report(chain)
```

---

## Phase 1: Retro

**Reuse `/retro` skill logic.**

### 1.1 Context Gathering

```bash
# Epic details
bd show $EPIC

# Recent commits
git log --oneline --since="7 days ago" | head -20

# Blackboard state
ls .agents/blackboard/
```

### 1.2 Friction Identification

Look for:
- Issues that took multiple attempts
- Blocked issues
- Issues with extensive comments
- Unexpected problems

```bash
# Issues with retry history
bd list --parent=$EPIC | while read issue; do
    bd show $issue | grep -i "retry\|blocked\|failed"
done
```

### 1.3 Learnings Extraction

| Learning Type | Source | Output |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| What went wrong | Blocked issues, retries | Learnings artifact |
| What went right | Fast completions | Patterns artifact |
| Process improvements | Session analysis | CLAUDE.md proposals |

---

## Phase 2: Vibe Validation

**Run full vibe on changed code.**

```bash
/vibe recent --create-issues
```

### Aspects to Check

| Aspect | Focus | Critical Threshold |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| Quality | Code smells, patterns | 0 CRITICAL |
| Security | OWASP, injection, auth | 0 CRITICAL |
| Architecture | Boundaries, coupling | 2 HIGH |
| Complexity | CC, nesting, size | 5 HIGH |
| Semantic | Docstrings, names | 2 HIGH |
| Performance | N+1, leaks | 1 CRITICAL |
| Slop | AI artifacts | 3 HIGH |

### Gate Criteria

| Level | Action |
|-------|--------|
| 0 CRITICAL | Proceed |
| 1+ CRITICAL | Block - must fix before considering complete |
| >10 HIGH | Warning - create follow-up issues |

---

## Phase 3: Security Scan

**Talos-class security validation.**

### 3.1 Static Analysis

```bash
# Secrets detection
gitleaks detect --source . --verbose 2>/dev/null || echo "gitleaks not installed"

# Dependency vulnerabilities (if applicable)
if [[ -f "requirements.txt" ]]; then
    pip-audit -r requirements.txt 2>/dev/null || echo "pip-audit not installed"
fi

if [[ -f "go.mod" ]]; then
    govulncheck ./... 2>/dev/null || echo "govulncheck not installed"
fi

if [[ -f "package.json" ]]; then
    npm audit 2>/dev/null || echo "npm audit failed"
fi
```

### 3.2 Pattern Detection

Run security-focused grep patterns:

```bash
# SQL injection patterns
grep -rn "execute.*%s\|execute.*format\|f\".*SELECT" --include="*.py" . 2>/dev/null

# Command injection patterns
grep -rn "subprocess.*shell=True\|os.system\|eval(" --include="*.py" . 2>/dev/null

# Hardcoded secrets
grep -rn "password.*=.*['\"].*['\"]|api_key.*=.*['\"]" --include="*.py" . 2>/dev/null
```

### 3.3 Expert Review (Optional)

For CRITICAL or HIGH security findings, spawn security expert:

```bash
Task(subagent_type="security-expert", prompt="Deep dive on security findings: ...")
```

---

## Phase 4: Knowledge Extraction

### 4.1 Learnings

Extract concrete learnings to artifacts:

```bash
# Output location
LEARNING_PATH=".agents/learnings/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-$EPIC.md"
```

**Learning Template:**
```markdown
# Learning: [Title]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Epic:** <epic-id>
**Tags:** [learning, topic1, topic2]

## Context
What were we trying to do?

## What We Learned
Concrete insight or pattern discovered.

## Evidence
- Commit abc123: [description]
- Issue xyz: [what happened]

## Application
How to use this knowledge in the future.

## Discovery Provenance
| Insight | Source Type | Source Detail |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| ... | grep/code-map/etc | file:line |
```

### 4.2 Patterns

If a reusable pattern was discovered:

```bash
PATTERN_PATH=".agents/patterns/$PATTERN_NAME.md"
```

### 4.3 Memories

Store in MCP for future recall:

```bash
mcp__ai-platform__memory_store(
    content="...",
    memory_type="fact",
    source="post-mortem:$EPIC",
    tags=["epic:$EPIC", "pattern:$PATTERN"]
)
```

### 4.4 Index to Flywheel (MANDATORY)

**Wire learnings into the knowledge flywheel so future `/research` finds them:**

```bash
# Index all artifacts for CASS searchability
ao forge index $LEARNING_PATH
ao forge index $PATTERN_PATH 2>/dev/null || true

# Index the retro document
ao forge index .agents/retros/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-$EPIC.md

# Mark as indexed for provenance
echo "indexed_at: $(date -Iseconds)" >> $LEARNING_PATH
```

**Why this matters:** Without indexing, learnings are written but not discoverable. The flywheel breaks - knowledge flows out but doesn't flow back in.

---

## Phase 5: Feed Back

### 5.0 Spec Validation (MANDATORY)

**Compare implementation results against spec goals. If mismatch, iterate.**

```bash
# Find original spec
SPEC=$(grep -l "$EPIC" .agents/specs/*.md | head -1)

if [[ -n "$SPEC" ]]; then
    # Extract spec quality goals (e.g., "0 CRITICAL findings")
    SPEC_GOAL=$(grep -i "quality.*goal\|acceptance.*criteria" $SPEC | head -3)

    # Compare against vibe results
    VIBE_CRITICAL=$(grep -c "CRITICAL" $VIBE_REPORT 2>/dev/null || echo "0")

    if [[ "$VIBE_CRITICAL" -gt 0 ]]; then
        echo "⚠️  SPEC MISMATCH: Found $VIBE_CRITICAL CRITICAL issues"
        echo "Spec goal was: $SPEC_GOAL"
        echo ""
        echo "Options:"
        echo "  1. Fix issues and re-run /vibe (iterate)"
        echo "  2. Update spec with learned constraints (adjust goals)"
        echo "  3. Accept delta and document (exception)"

        # Create delta artifact
        DELTA_PATH=".agents/deltas/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-$EPIC.md"
        mkdir -p .agents/deltas
        cat > $DELTA_PATH << EOF
# Spec-Reality Delta: $EPIC

**Date:** $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
**Spec:** $SPEC
**Goal:** $SPEC_GOAL
**Actual:** $VIBE_CRITICAL CRITICAL findings

## Analysis
[Why did we miss the spec goal?]

## Feedback to Spec
[What should the spec include next time?]
EOF
        echo "Delta recorded: $DELTA_PATH"
    else
        echo "✓ Spec goals met"
    fi
fi
```

**The Iteration Loop:** If spec-reality mismatch is unacceptable:
1. Don't proceed to Phase 6
2. Fix the issues
3. Re-run `/vibe`
4. Resume `/post-mortem` when clean

### 5.1 Spec Update (Optional)

If `--update-spec` is set and original spec exists:

```bash
# Find original spec
SPEC=$(grep -l "$EPIC" .agents/specs/*.md | head -1)

if [[ -n "$SPEC" ]]; then
    # Append lessons learned section
    echo -e "\n## Post-Implementation Learnings\n" >> $SPEC
    echo "Added after $EPIC completion on $(date +%Y-%m-%d):" >> $SPEC
    echo "- [Learning 1]" >> $SPEC
    echo "- [Learning 2]" >> $SPEC
fi
```

### 5.2 Formula Update (Optional)

If a formula was used and can be improved:

```bash
FORMULA=$(ls .formula.toml 2>/dev/null)
if [[ -n "$FORMULA" ]]; then
    # Note: Manual review recommended for formula updates
    echo "Formula found: $FORMULA"
    echo "Consider updating with lessons learned"
fi
```

---

## Phase 6: Report

### Summary Template

```markdown
# Post-Mortem Complete: [Epic Title]

**Epic:** <epic-id>
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Duration:** X days (from start to close)
**Discovery Method:** Session transcript / Beads heuristic

## Provenance Chain

### Research Phase
- **Artifact:** `.agents/research/YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`
- **Key Findings:** [extracted from research]

### Product Phase
- **Brief:** `.agents/products/product-name.md` (if applicable)

### Pre-Mortem Phase
- **Results:** `.claude/plans/xxx-agent-xxx.md`
- **Issues Found:** N critical, M important

### Implementation Phase
- **Plan:** `.claude/plans/xxx.md`
- **Commits:** N
- **Key Decisions:**
  1. [Decision from AskUserQuestion or comment]
  2. [Decision from commit message]

## Retro Summary
- **Friction Points:** N identified
- **Key Learning:** [Most important insight]
- **Process Improvements:** M proposed

## Vibe Results
| Severity | Count | Action |
|----------|-------|--------|
| CRITICAL | 0 | N/A |
| HIGH | 3 | Issues created |
| MEDIUM | 7 | Follow-up |

## Security Scan
- **Secrets:** 0 detected
- **Vulnerabilities:** 0 found
- **Patterns:** 2 flagged for review

## Knowledge Extracted
- **Learnings:** .agents/learnings/YYYY-MM-DD-epic.md
- **Patterns:** 1 new pattern discovered
- **Memories:** 3 stored in MCP

## Follow-Up Issues Created
- <issue-1>: Fix HIGH vibe finding
- <issue-2>: Address security pattern

## Spec Feedback
- Original spec: [path]
- Updated: [yes/no]

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Review and merge follow-up issues
2. Consider spec updates for next similar project
3. Knowledge automatically available for next /research
```

---

## Phase 7: Lock the Ratchet

**Final step: Record provenance and close the loop.**

```bash
# Record post-mortem completion in the ratchet chain
ao ratchet record post-mortem \
  --input "epic:$EPIC" \
  --output ".agents/retros/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-$EPIC.md" \
  --output ".agents/learnings/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-$EPIC.md"

# Verify the complete chain
ao ratchet verify --epic "$EPIC"

# If verification passes, the chain is:
# research → spec → plan → implement → vibe → post-mortem (LOCKED)
```

**The ratchet is now locked.** This epic's learnings are:
- Indexed via `ao forge index` (searchable)
- Recorded in the chain (traceable)
- Available to future `/research` via `ao forge search`

**The flywheel turns:** Next `/research` on a similar topic will find these learnings automatically.

## ao CLI Integration

Post-mortem closes the Knowledge Flywheel via ao ratchet:

```bash
# 1. Index all knowledge artifacts
ao forge index .agents/retros/<epic>.md
ao forge index .agents/learnings/<epic>.md
ao forge index .agents/patterns/*.md

# 2. Record completion with provenance chain
ao ratchet record post-mortem \
  --input "epic:<epic-id>" \
  --output "retro:$(ls .agents/retros/*<epic>* | head -1)" \
  --output "learnings:$(ls .agents/learnings/*<epic>* | head -1)"

# 3. Verify loop closure
ao ratchet verify --epic "<epic-id>"
```

The ratchet locks progress: once indexed, future `/research` will discover these artifacts.

**Post-mortem is the capstone skill** that closes the loop, ensuring every implementation produces validated code and extracted knowledge that improves future work.

---

## Knowledge Loop Closure (CRITICAL)

**The loop is only closed when post-mortem outputs become research inputs.**

### Output → Input Mapping

| Post-mortem Output | Location | How /research Consumes It |
|--------------------|----------|---------------------------|
| **Retro artifact** | `.agents/retros/YYYY-MM-DD-epic.md` | Prior art search (Tier 5) |
| **Learnings** | `.agents/learnings/YYYY-MM-DD-epic.md` | Prior art search (Tier 5) |
| **Patterns** | `.agents/patterns/*.md` | Prior art search (Tier 5) |
| **MCP memories** | PostgreSQL via ETL | `mcp__ai-platform__memory_recall()` (Tier 2) |
| **Updated specs** | `.agents/specs/*.md` | Prior art search (Tier 5) |

### The 5 Connection Points

```
POST-MORTEM OUTPUTS              →    RESEARCH INPUTS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. RETROS (.agents/retros/)
   "What went wrong with auth?"
                                 →    ls .agents/retros/ | grep auth
                                      # Found: 2026-01-15-auth-migration-retro.md
                                      # Contains: "Token refresh race condition"

2. LEARNINGS (.agents/learnings/)
   "Concrete insight about testing"
                                 →    ls .agents/learnings/ | grep test
                                      # Found: 2026-01-10-testing-learnings.md
                                      # Contains: "Mock external services, not internal"

3. PATTERNS (.agents/patterns/)
   "Reusable solution to X"
                                 →    ls .agents/patterns/
                                      # Found: retry-with-backoff.md
                                      # Applies to: network failures

4. MCP MEMORIES
   mcp__ai-platform__memory_store(
       content="Always validate JWT exp claim",
       tags=["auth", "jwt", "security"]
   )
                                 →    mcp__ai-platform__memory_recall(
                                          query="JWT authentication patterns"
                                      )
                                      # Returns: "Always validate JWT exp claim"

5. UPDATED SPECS
   Original spec + learnings
                                 →    grep -l "$TOPIC" .agents/specs/
                                      # Found spec with "Post-Implementation Learnings" section
```

### Research Skill Integration (Required)

For the loop to work, `/research` MUST check these sources:

```bash
# Phase: Prior Art (Tier 5) - MUST include:

# 1. Retros from similar work
ls .agents/retros/ 2>/dev/null | grep -i "$TOPIC" | head -5

# 2. Learnings from similar work
ls .agents/learnings/ 2>/dev/null | grep -i "$TOPIC" | head -5

# 3. Patterns that might apply
ls .agents/patterns/ 2>/dev/null

# 4. MCP memory recall
mcp__ai-platform__memory_recall(query="$TOPIC", limit=5)

# 5. Prior research (already in /research)
ls .agents/research/ | grep -i "$TOPIC"
```

### Verification: Is the Loop Closed?

Run this check before starting new research:

```bash
# Check if knowledge from previous work exists
RIG="athena"
TOPIC="authentication"

echo "=== Checking Knowledge Loop for: $TOPIC ==="

echo -e "\n1. Retros:"
ls .agents/retros/*$TOPIC* 2>/dev/null || echo "   None"

echo -e "\n2. Learnings:"
ls .agents/learnings/*$TOPIC* 2>/dev/null || echo "   None"

echo -e "\n3. Patterns:"
grep -l "$TOPIC" .agents/patterns/*.md 2>/dev/null || echo "   None"

echo -e "\n4. MCP Memories:"
# mcp__ai-platform__memory_recall(query="$TOPIC", limit=3)

echo -e "\n5. Prior Research:"
ls .agents/research/*$TOPIC* 2>/dev/null || echo "   None"
```

### Anti-Pattern: Broken Loop

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Same mistakes repeated | Retros not consulted | Add retro check to research |
| Reinventing solutions | Patterns not discovered | Add pattern search to research |
| Lost context | MCP memories not recalled | Add memory_recall to research |
| Specs don't improve | Learnings not appended | Enable `--update-spec` in post-mortem |

### Mandatory Loop Closure Checklist

Before considering post-mortem complete:

- [ ] Retro artifact written to `.agents/retros/`
- [ ] Key learnings extracted to `.agents/learnings/`
- [ ] Reusable patterns documented in `.agents/patterns/`
- [ ] Critical insights stored via `mcp__ai-platform__memory_store()`
- [ ] Original spec updated with learnings (if applicable)
- [ ] **VERIFIED**: Future `/research` will find these artifacts
