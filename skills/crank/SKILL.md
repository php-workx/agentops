# Crank Skill

> **Quick Ref:** Autonomous epic execution. Local mode: `/swarm` for each wave with runtime-native spawning. Distributed mode: `/swarm --mode=distributed` (tmux + Agent Mail). Output: closed issues + final vibe.

**YOU MUST EXECUTE THIS WORKFLOW. Do not just describe it.**

Autonomous execution: implement all issues until the epic is DONE.

**CLI dependencies:** bd (issue tracking), ao (knowledge flywheel). Both optional — see `skills/shared/SKILL.md` for fallback table. If bd is unavailable, use TaskList for issue tracking and skip beads sync. If ao is unavailable, skip knowledge injection/extraction.

## Architecture: Crank + Swarm

**Beads mode** (bd available):
```
Crank (orchestrator)           Swarm (executor)
    |                              |
    +-> bd ready (wave issues)     |
    |                              |
    +-> TaskCreate from beads  --->+-> Select spawn backend (codex sub-agents | claude teams | fallback)
    |                              |
    +-> /swarm                 --->+-> Spawn workers per backend
    |                              |   (fresh context per wave)
    +-> Verify + bd update     <---+-> Workers report via backend channel
    |                              |
    +-> Loop until epic DONE   <---+-> Cleanup backend resources after wave
```

**TaskList mode** (bd unavailable):
```
Crank (orchestrator, TaskList mode)    Swarm (executor)
    |                                      |
    +-> TaskList() (wave tasks)            |
    |                                      |
    +-> /swarm                         --->+-> Select spawn backend per wave
    |                                      |
    +-> Verify via TaskList()          <---+-> Workers report via backend channel
    |                                      |
    +-> Loop until all completed       <---+-> Cleanup backend resources after wave
```

**Separation of concerns:**
- **Crank** = Orchestration, epic/task lifecycle, knowledge flywheel
- **Swarm** = Runtime-native parallel execution (Ralph Wiggum pattern via fresh worker set per wave)

## Global Limits

**MAX_EPIC_WAVES = 50** (hard limit across entire epic)

This prevents infinite loops on circular dependencies or cascading failures.

**Why 50?**
- Typical epic: 5-10 issues
- With retries: ~5 waves max
- 50 = safe upper bound

## Completion Enforcement (The Sisyphus Rule)

**THE SISYPHUS RULE:** Not done until explicitly DONE.

After each wave, output completion marker:
- `<promise>DONE</promise>` - Epic truly complete, all issues closed
- `<promise>BLOCKED</promise>` - Cannot proceed (with reason)
- `<promise>PARTIAL</promise>` - Incomplete (with remaining items)

**Never claim completion without the marker.**

## Execution Steps

Given `/crank [epic-id | plan-file.md | "description"]`:

### Step 0: Load Knowledge Context (ao Integration)

**Search for relevant learnings before starting the epic:**

```bash
# If ao CLI available, inject prior knowledge about epic execution
if command -v ao &>/dev/null; then
    # Search for relevant learnings
    ao search "epic execution implementation patterns" 2>/dev/null | head -20

    # Check flywheel status
    ao flywheel status 2>/dev/null

    # Get current ratchet state
    ao ratchet status 2>/dev/null
fi
```

If ao not available, skip this step and proceed. The knowledge flywheel enhances but is not required.

### Step 0.5: Detect Tracking Mode

```bash
if command -v bd &>/dev/null; then
  TRACKING_MODE="beads"
else
  TRACKING_MODE="tasklist"
  echo "Note: bd CLI not found. Using TaskList for issue tracking."
fi
```

**Tracking mode determines the source of truth for the rest of the workflow:**

| | Beads Mode | TaskList Mode |
|---|---|---|
| **Source of truth** | `bd` (beads issues) | TaskList (Claude-native) |
| **Find work** | `bd ready` | `TaskList()` → pending, unblocked |
| **Get details** | `bd show <id>` | `TaskGet(taskId)` |
| **Mark complete** | `bd update <id> --status closed` | `TaskUpdate(taskId, status="completed")` |
| **Track retries** | `bd comments add` | Task description update |
| **Epic tracking** | `bd update <epic-id> --append-notes` | In-memory wave counter |

### Step 1: Identify the Epic / Work Source

**Beads mode:**

**If epic ID provided:** Use it directly. Do NOT ask for confirmation.

**If no epic ID:** Discover it:
```bash
bd list --type epic --status open 2>/dev/null | head -5
```

If multiple epics found, ask user which one.

**TaskList mode:**

If input is an epic ID → Error: "bd CLI required for beads epic tracking. Install bd or provide a plan file / task list."

If input is a plan file path (`.md`):
1. Read the plan file
2. Decompose into TaskList tasks (one `TaskCreate` per distinct work item)
3. Set up dependencies via `TaskUpdate(addBlockedBy)`
4. Proceed to Step 3

If no input:
1. Check `TaskList()` for existing pending tasks
2. If tasks exist, use them as the work items
3. If no tasks, ask user what to work on

If input is a description string:
1. Decompose into tasks (`TaskCreate` for each)
2. Set up dependencies
3. Proceed to Step 3

### Step 1a: Initialize Wave Counter

**Beads mode:**
```bash
# Initialize crank tracking in epic notes
bd update <epic-id> --append-notes "CRANK_START: wave=0 at $(date -Iseconds)" 2>/dev/null
```

**TaskList mode:** Track wave counter in memory only. No external state needed.

Track in memory: `wave=0`

### Step 2: Get Epic Details

**Beads mode:**
```bash
bd show <epic-id> 2>/dev/null
```

**TaskList mode:** `TaskList()` to see all tasks and their status/dependencies.

### Step 3: List Ready Issues (Current Wave)

**Beads mode:**

Find issues that can be worked on (no blockers):
```bash
bd ready 2>/dev/null
```

**`bd ready` returns the current wave** - all unblocked issues. These can be executed in parallel because they have no dependencies on each other.

**TaskList mode:**

`TaskList()` → filter for status=pending, no blockedBy (or all blockers completed). These are the current wave.

### Step 3a: Pre-flight Check - Issues Exist

**Verify there are issues to work on:**

**If 0 ready issues found (beads mode) or 0 pending unblocked tasks (TaskList mode):**
```
STOP and return error:
  "No ready issues found for this epic. Either:
   - All issues are blocked (check dependencies)
   - Epic has no child issues (run /plan first)
   - All issues already completed"
```

Also verify: epic has at least 1 child issue total. An epic with 0 children means /plan was not run.

Do NOT proceed with empty issue list - this produces false "epic complete" status.

### Step 4: Execute Wave via Swarm

**BEFORE each wave:**
```bash
wave=$((wave + 1))
WAVE_START_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)

if [[ "$TRACKING_MODE" == "beads" ]]; then
    bd update <epic-id> --append-notes "CRANK_WAVE: $wave at $(date -Iseconds)" 2>/dev/null
fi

# CHECK GLOBAL LIMIT
if [[ $wave -ge 50 ]]; then
    echo "<promise>BLOCKED</promise>"
    echo "Global wave limit (50) reached."
    # STOP - do not continue
fi
```

**For wave execution details (beads sync, TaskList bridging, swarm invocation), read `skills/crank/references/team-coordination.md`.**

### Step 5: Verify and Sync to Beads (MANDATORY)

> Swarm executes per-task validation (see `skills/shared/validation-contract.md`). Crank trusts swarm validation and focuses on beads sync.

**For verification details, retry logic, and failure escalation, read `skills/crank/references/team-coordination.md` and `skills/crank/references/failure-recovery.md`.**

### Step 5.5: Wave Vibe Gate (MANDATORY)

> **Principle:** Fresh context catches what saturated context misses. No self-grading.

**For wave vibe gate details (diff computation, acceptance criteria, verdict gating), read `skills/crank/references/wave-patterns.md`.**

### Step 5.7: Wave Checkpoint

After each wave completes (post-vibe-gate, pre-next-wave), write a checkpoint file:

```bash
mkdir -p .agents/crank

cat > ".agents/crank/wave-${wave}-checkpoint.json" <<EOF
{
  "wave": ${wave},
  "timestamp": "$(date -Iseconds)",
  "tasks_completed": $(echo "$COMPLETED_IDS" | jq -R 'split(" ")'),
  "tasks_failed": $(echo "$FAILED_IDS" | jq -R 'split(" ")'),
  "files_changed": $(git diff --name-only "${WAVE_START_SHA}..HEAD" | jq -R . | jq -s .),
  "git_sha": "$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
}
EOF
```

- `COMPLETED_IDS` / `FAILED_IDS`: space-separated issue IDs from the wave results.
- On retry of the same wave, the file is overwritten (same path).
- Checkpoint files are informational — no resume logic reads them yet (future work).

### Step 6: Check for More Work

After completing a wave, check for newly unblocked issues (beads: `bd ready`, TaskList: `TaskList()`). Loop back to Step 4 if work remains, or proceed to Step 7 when done.

**For detailed check/retry logic, read `skills/crank/references/team-coordination.md`.**

### Step 7: Final Batched Validation

When all issues complete, run ONE comprehensive vibe on recent changes. Fix CRITICAL issues before completion.

**For detailed validation steps, read `skills/crank/references/failure-recovery.md`.**

### Step 8: Extract Learnings (ao Integration)

If ao CLI available: run `ao forge transcript`, `ao flywheel status`, and `ao pool list --tier=pending` to extract and review learnings. If ao unavailable, skip and recommend `/post-mortem` manually.

### Step 9: Report Completion

Tell the user:
1. Epic ID and title
2. Number of issues completed
3. Total iterations used (of 50 max)
4. Final vibe results
5. Flywheel status (if ao available)
6. Suggest running `/post-mortem` to review and promote learnings

**Output completion marker:**
```
<promise>DONE</promise>
Epic: <epic-id>
Issues completed: N
Iterations: M/50
Flywheel: <status from ao flywheel status>
```

If stopped early:
```
<promise>BLOCKED</promise>
Reason: <global limit reached | unresolvable blockers>
Issues remaining: N
Iterations: M/50
```

## The FIRE Loop

Crank follows FIRE (Find → Ignite → Reap → Vibe → Escalate) for each wave. Loop until all issues are CLOSED (beads) or all tasks are completed (TaskList).

**For FIRE loop details, parallel wave models, and wave vibe gate, read `skills/crank/references/wave-patterns.md`.**

## Key Rules

- **Auto-detect tracking** - check for `bd` at start; use TaskList if absent
- **Plan files as input** - `/crank plan.md` decomposes plan into tasks automatically
- **If epic ID given, USE IT** - don't ask for confirmation (beads mode only)
- **Swarm for each wave** - delegates parallel execution to swarm
- **Fresh context per issue** - swarm provides Ralph pattern isolation
- **Batch validation at end** - ONE vibe at the end saves context
- **Fix CRITICAL before completion** - address findings before reporting done
- **Loop until done** - don't stop until all issues closed / tasks completed
- **Autonomous execution** - minimize human prompts
- **Respect wave limit** - STOP at 50 waves (hard limit)
- **Output completion markers** - DONE, BLOCKED, or PARTIAL (required)
- **Knowledge flywheel** - load learnings at start, forge at end (ao optional)
- **Beads ↔ TaskList sync** - in beads mode, crank bridges beads issues to TaskList for swarm

## Distributed Mode: Agent Mail Orchestration (Experimental)

> **Status: Experimental.** Local mode (TaskList + swarm) is the recommended execution method.

**For distributed mode details (architecture, execution steps, Chiron pattern, file reservations, checkpoint handling), read `skills/crank/references/distributed-mode.md`.**
