> /orchestrate-roadmap-completion is running… we need to brain storm how
to imrpove our website. right now we explore good stack info, we have
700+ plugins, but we cant make sense of the data. we have no real routing
 set up to help the skill. We ahve no real way of tracking patterns on
teh fly. We have no way of setting claude lose to discover patterns
naturally without humans instructing them\
\
We need to really focus in on a mission for the plugin marketplace
idea/agentops in general. What problem is it solving? what is the
consultant " so What?" we are selling?\
\
Here is my idea and you help me see if this is a good idea or steer me in
 the right direction:\
1. I dont want to make a tool. Anthropic and other devs are much more
experienced and move faster. Better for me to focus on what im good at
and that s finding efficient/operational ways to integrate all htese
tools to bring value reliably.\
\
To me the problem i want to solve is we have this powerful tool (claude
code and other ai coding agents), but we dont have a verified workflow we
 can follow to get the best out of them reliably.\
\
Anthropic keeps making this tool ecosystem and leading thought leadership
 in trying to give best practices, but this leaves users (even power
users) wasting tons of tme trying plugins, skills, slashcommands, and
overall wasting precious tokens.\
\
My goal is to build an automated meta system to help filter and anlyze al
 lthese tools that anthropic and the community make, find out what
actually works and what is fluff. what is a waste. How do we abstract the
 core factors (like 12 factor apps before) that make up the ideal work
flow with agentic ai. Im trying to explore both. The workflow and what
tools best enable that workflow.\
\
I want this as the misison. I just want to be able to say, hey, i ran
these ETL/ML/Claude Code trial/error whatever on all the tools and here
are my results. I recommend these and also recommend people contributing
and sharing their results with each tool. \
\
Kind of like an agregator and place people go to get benchmarks on tools
and workflows, while also extracing all the best patterns from each and
builting an abstract set of factors.
