# Career Strategy: Methodology + Internal Adoption + Public Visibility

**The Insight:** Maintaining tooling sucks. Crafting internal workflows and building adoption is more valuable. Public visibility positions you for top AI companies.

**Your Position:** Senior Platform Engineer + Active Builder = Thought Leader in AI Agent Operations

---

## The Strategic Pivot

### From: Building and Maintaining Public Tooling
**To:** Defining Methodology + Internal Adoption + Public Visibility

### Why This Works

**1. Internal Adoption = Real Value**
- You solve real problems at your company
- You prove methodology works in production
- You build organizational knowledge (the real moat)
- You create measurable impact (40x speedup, 95% success rate)

**2. Public Visibility = Career Positioning**
- Methodology repo (`12-factor-agentops/`) = Thought leadership
- Case studies = Proof you can deliver
- Public speaking/writing = Visibility to top AI companies
- No maintenance burden = Focus on high-value work

**3. Senior Platform Engineer + Active Builder = Unique Position**
- You understand operations at scale (federal, production)
- You're actively building (not just theorizing)
- You're solving real problems (not academic exercises)
- You're positioned as practitioner + thought leader
