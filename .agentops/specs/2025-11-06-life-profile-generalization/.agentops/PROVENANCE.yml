description: "Transform life profile into universal personal-development workflow package"

# Context
origin: "User request to make life profile life-agnostic and universal"
parent_spec: null
related_specs: []
dependencies: []

# Scope
files_affected: 39
  - 33 existing files (transform)
  - 6 new files (create examples/, CUSTOMIZATION_GUIDE.md)
estimated_effort: "2-3 days systematic execution"

# Approach
strategy: "Template-Based Abstraction (Approach B)"
pattern: "Personal references → Customizable placeholders"
preservation: "All proven patterns and workflows maintained"
attribution: "Original implementation preserved in examples/ directory"

# Validation
validation_strategy:
  - "grep-based placeholder verification"
  - "Functional testing of templates"
  - "Cross-reference validation"
  - "Examples self-containment check"

# Risk mitigation
rollback_procedure: "git revert (5 minutes)"
backup_strategy: "Git history preservation"
high_risk_areas:
  - "Cross-file reference breakage during transformation"
  - "Incomplete placeholder replacement"
