### **The Missing Memory Layer for AI Development**
**Your AI assistant shouldn't start from zero every session.**

---

## **Why AgentOps?**

You've been there: You spend 45 minutes teaching Claude how to debug a specific OAuth issue in your repo. Two weeks later, the issue returns. You open a new session, and **Claude has forgotten everything.** You pay the time (and token) cost all over again.

**AgentOps fixes this.** It runs in the background to:
1.  **Capture** successful patterns from your coding sessions.
2.  **Store** them in your repo (`.agents/`) as permanent knowledge.
3.  **Inject** that context automatically when you start a new task.

**Result:** Your assistant gets smarter—effectively *compounding* knowledge instead of resetting it.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install the Plugin
Add the AgentOps toolset to your Claude Code configuration.

```bash
claude mcp add boshu2/agentops
```

### 2. Install the CLI

The `ao` CLI manages your knowledge base and search index.

```bash
brew install agentops
# Or build from source:
# cd cli && go build -o ao ./cmd/ao
```

### 3. Start Your Flywheel

Initialize the knowledge base in your repository.

```bash
ao init
```

## 🔄 The Workflow: R.P.I.

Stop "vibing" random code. Use the **RPI** loop to build software systematically.

| Phase | Command | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Research** | `/research` | Deep scans your codebase & loads past learnings. |
| **2. Plan** | `/plan` | Breaks your goal into tracked issues/steps. |
| **3. Implement** | `/implement` | Executes the code. |
| **4. Validate** | `/vibe` | Runs tests, linters, and checks quality. |
| **5. Learn** | `/retro` | **Crucial:** Extracts what worked and saves it for next time. |

## ✨ Features

### 🧠 Permanent Memory (.agents/)

Instead of ephemeral chat logs, we store knowledge in your repo.

* **Learnings:** High-level takeaways (e.g., "The auth service requires a 2-second delay on retry").
* **Patterns:** Reusable code snippets and architecture decisions.
* **Searchable:** The `ao` CLI indexes this so Claude finds it instantly.

### 🔌 Powerful Skills

Your Claude instance gains specialized commands:

* **`/crank`**: Autonomous execution. Give it a goal, and it loops through RPI until done.
* **`/pre-mortem`**: Scans for risks *before* writing code.
* **`/bug-hunt`**: Specialized root-cause analysis workflow.
* **`/forge`**: Mines old transcripts to extract gold nuggets of knowledge you missed.

### 📊 The 'ao' CLI

Manage your AI's brain from the terminal.

```bash
# Check your knowledge health
$ ao badge
> COMPOUNDING (Retrieval Rate: 72%)

# Search your team's collective learnings
$ ao search "oauth retry"

# Manually ingest a past session
$ ao forge transcript ./session-logs/debug_session.txt
```

## ⚡ Comparison

| Feature | Standard Claude Code | **With AgentOps** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Session Memory** | Gone when tab closes | **Persisted forever** |
| **Context** | Generic training data | **Your specific codebase history** |
| **Improvement** | Static (wait for model updates) | **Compounds daily** |
| **Cost** | Re-explain everything ($) | **Recall instantly (¢)** |

## 📁 Knowledge Storage

AgentOps stores knowledge in `.agents/`:

```
.agents/
├── learnings/    # Extracted lessons (what we learned)
├── patterns/     # Reusable solutions (how we solved it)
├── research/     # Exploration findings (what we found)
├── retros/       # Retrospectives (what went wrong/right)
└── ao/
    ├── sessions/ # Mined transcripts
    └── index/    # Search index
```

**Dual format:** Every artifact has `.md` (human-readable) and `.jsonl` (machine-queryable).
