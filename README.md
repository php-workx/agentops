**Your AI agent has amnesia. Let's fix that.**

> Other tools make Claude faster. AgentOps makes Claude *smarter*.

## The Problem Everyone Ignores

Your agent solves a bug today. Tomorrow? Same bug, starts from scratch.

You explain your architecture once. Next week? Explain it again.

**Every session is day one.**

| Approach | Promise | Reality |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Spec-driven dev | "Perfect spec → perfect code" | Specs are discovered during implementation |
| Better prompts | "Just prompt engineer harder" | Knowledge dies when the session ends |
| RAG/embeddings | "Search your codebase" | No learning, just lookup |
| Other workflows | "Follow these 12 steps" | Linear, no memory, no compounding |

**The dirty secret:** None of these remember what they learned.

---

## The Solution: Compounding Knowledge

AgentOps captures what your agent learns and feeds it back. Every session makes the next one smarter.

```
Session 1        Session 10       Session 100
+-----------+    +-----------+    +-----------+
|  Debug    |    |  "I've    |    |  Domain   |
|  auth bug |    |  seen     |    |  expert   |
|  (2 hrs)  | -> |  this"    | -> |  instant  |
|           |    |  (10 min) |    |  recall   |
+-----------+    +-----------+    +-----------+

    Same effort        10x faster       100x faster
```

**The math:** Knowledge decays at ~17%/week without reinforcement.
AgentOps retrieval × usage > decay rate = **compounding, not forgetting**.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install CLI
brew tap boshu2/agentops https://github.com/boshu2/homebrew-agentops
brew install agentops

# 2. Install Plugin
claude plugin marketplace add boshu2/agentops
claude plugin install agentops

# 3. Initialize (in your project)
ao init && ao hooks install
```

**That's it.** Hooks capture knowledge automatically. Every session feeds the next.

---

## What's New in v1.0.0

**The Knowledge Flywheel release.** Your agent now remembers and compounds knowledge.

- **20 skills** organized into Core Workflow, Validation, Knowledge System, and Integration
- **Brownian Ratchet** - Physics-inspired progress model: Chaos → Filter → Ratchet
- **`ao` CLI** - Session management, knowledge forging, provenance tracking
- **Auto-hooks** - SessionStart injects knowledge, SessionEnd extracts learnings

See [RELEASE-NOTES.md](RELEASE-NOTES.md) for full history.

## How It Works

### The Brownian Ratchet

In physics, a Brownian ratchet extracts useful work from random motion. Molecules bounce chaotically, but the ratchet only allows forward movement.

**AgentOps applies this to AI agents:**

| Phase | What Happens | You Type |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| **Research** | Mine prior knowledge, explore codebase | `/research` |
| **Plan** | Break into tracked issues | `/plan` |
| **Pre-mortem** | Simulate failures before they happen | `/pre-mortem` |
| **Crank** | Implement → validate → commit loop | `/crank` |
| **Post-mortem** | Extract learnings, lock the ratchet | `/post-mortem` |

## What Gets Captured

Everything lives in `.agents/` — git-tracked, portable, yours.

```
.agents/
├── learnings/     # "Auth bugs usually come from token refresh"
├── patterns/      # "Here's how we handle retries in this codebase"
├── research/      # Deep dive outputs
├── specs/         # Validated specifications
└── retros/        # Session retrospectives
```

**Hooks run automatically:**
- **SessionStart** → Injects relevant prior knowledge
- **SessionEnd** → Extracts and indexes learnings

You don't run `ao` commands manually. The flywheel turns itself.

---

## The Compound Effect

```
WITHOUT AGENTOPS
================
Session 1     Session 2     Session 3     Session 4
[2 hours] --> [2 hours] --> [2 hours] --> [2 hours]  = 8 hours
  (same problem, every time)

WITH AGENTOPS
=============
Session 1     Session 2     Session 3     Session 4
[2 hours] --> [10 min]  --> [2 min]   --> [instant]  = ~2.2 hours
  (learn)      (recall)     (refine)     (mastered)
```

**By session 100, your agent knows:**
- Every bug you've ever fixed
- Your architecture decisions and why
- Your team's coding patterns
- What approaches failed and why
