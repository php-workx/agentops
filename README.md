```
> /rpi "add rate limiting to the API"

[research]    Exploring codebase... → .agents/research/rate-limiting.md
[plan]        3 issues, 2 waves → epic ag-0057
[pre-mortem]  3 judges → Verdict: PASS
[crank]       Wave 1: ███ 2/2 · Wave 2: █ 1/1
[vibe]        3 judges → Verdict: PASS
[post-mortem] 3 learnings extracted → .agents/
```

That's six phases — research, planning, failure simulation, parallel implementation, code validation, and learning extraction — running autonomously. Failed validation triggers a retry with the failure context. Ratchet gates lock each phase so progress can't go backward. You type one command and walk away.

<details>
<summary><strong>More examples</strong></summary>

**Autonomous epic execution:**
```
> /crank ag-0042

[crank] Epic: ag-0042 — 6 issues, 3 waves
[wave-1] ██████ 3/3 complete
[wave-2] ████── 2/2 complete
[wave-3] ██──── 1/1 complete
[vibe] PASS — all gates locked
[post-mortem] 4 learnings extracted → .agents/
```

**Multi-model validation council:**
```
> /council --deep validate the auth system

[council] 3 judges spawned
[judge-1] PASS — JWT implementation correct
[judge-2] WARN — rate limiting missing on /login
[judge-3] PASS — refresh rotation implemented
Consensus: WARN — add rate limiting before shipping
```

**Parallel agents with fresh context:**
```
> /swarm ag-0042 --wave=1

[swarm] Spawning 3 workers (clean context each)
[worker-1] ✓ ag-001 — add middleware
[worker-2] ✓ ag-002 — add rate limiter
[worker-3] ✓ ag-003 — add config schema
[lead] Validated → committed 3 files
```

**Try it in 60 seconds:** After install, run `/quickstart` — it walks you through a guided RPI cycle on your actual codebase.

## How It Works

AgentOps is built on four ideas: a physics metaphor for reliable agent output, a memory pattern for compounding intelligence, an execution model for safe parallelism, and an orchestration loop that wires them together.

### The Brownian Ratchet

```
  Chaos × Filter → Locked Progress

  ╭─ agent-1 ─→ ✓ ─╮
  ├─ agent-2 ─→ ✗ ─┤   3 attempts, 1 fails
  ├─ agent-3 ─→ ✓ ─┤   filter catches it
  ╰─ council ──→ PASS   ratchet locks the progress
                  ↓
          can't go backward
```

Spawn parallel agents (chaos), validate with multi-model council (filter), merge to main (ratchet). Failed agents are cheap — fresh context means no contamination. Progress only moves forward.

### Ralph Loops

```
  Wave 1:  TeamCreate → spawn 3 workers (fresh context each)
           workers write files → lead validates → lead commits
           TeamDelete

  Wave 2:  TeamCreate → spawn 2 workers (fresh context each)
           ...same pattern, zero accumulated context
```

Every wave gets a new team. Every worker gets clean context. No bleed-through between waves. The lead is the only one who commits — eliminates merge conflicts across parallel workers.

### Knowledge Flywheel

```
  Session 1:  work → ao forge → extract learnings → .agents/
  Session 2:  ao inject → .agents/ loaded → work → extract → .agents/
  Session 3:  ao inject → richer context → work → extract → .agents/
                          compounds over time ↑
```

The `ao` CLI auto-injects relevant knowledge at session start and auto-extracts learnings at session end. Decisions, patterns, failures, and fixes accumulate in `.agents/` — your agents get smarter with every cycle.

### Context Orchestration

```
  /rpi "goal"
    │
    ├─ Phase 1: /research ─── explore codebase
    ├─ Phase 2: /plan ─────── decompose into issues + waves
    ├─ Phase 3: /pre-mortem ── 3-judge council validates plan
    │                          FAIL? → re-plan → re-validate (max 3)
    ├─ Phase 4: /crank ─────── autonomous wave execution
    │                          BLOCKED? → retry with context (max 3)
    ├─ Phase 5: /vibe ──────── 3-judge council validates code
    │                          FAIL? → re-crank → re-vibe (max 3)
    └─ Phase 6: /post-mortem ─ extract learnings → .agents/
```

Six phases, zero human gates. Council FAIL triggers retry loops — re-plan or re-crank with the failure context, then re-validate. Ratchet checkpoints after each phase lock progress. Use `--interactive` if you want human gates at research and plan.

## Skills Catalog

33 skills across three tiers — orchestration, workflow, and utilities — plus 8 internal skills that fire automatically.

### Orchestration

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| `/rpi` | Goal to production — autonomous 6-phase lifecycle with self-correcting retry loops |
| `/council` | Multi-model consensus — spawns parallel judges, consolidates verdict (default, `--deep`, `--mixed`) |
| `/crank` | Autonomous epic execution — runs `/swarm` waves until all issues closed |
| `/swarm` | Parallel agents with fresh context — team per wave, lead commits |
| `/codex-team` | Parallel Codex agents orchestrated by Claude — cross-vendor execution |

### Workflow

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| `/research` | Deep codebase exploration → `.agents/research/` |
| `/plan` | Decompose goal into issues with dependency waves |
| `/implement` | Single issue, full lifecycle — explore, code, test, commit |

| `/pre-mortem` | Simulate failures before coding (3 judges: requirements, feasibility, scope) |
| `/post-mortem` | Validate implementation + extract learnings |
| `/release` | Pre-flight checks, changelog, version bumps, tag, GitHub Release |

### Utilities

<details>
<summary><strong>Internal skills (auto-loaded, 8 total)</strong></summary>

| Skill | Trigger | What it does |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `inject` | Session start | Load relevant prior knowledge into session context |
| `extract` | On demand | Pull learnings from artifacts |
| `forge` | Session end | Mine transcript for decisions, learnings, failures, patterns |
| `flywheel` | On demand | Knowledge health — velocity, pool depths, staleness |
| `ratchet` | On demand | RPI progress gates — once locked, stays locked |
| `standards` | By `/vibe`, `/implement` | Language-specific coding rules (Python, Go, TS, Shell) |
| `beads` | By `/plan`, `/implement` | Git-native issue tracking reference |
| `provenance` | On demand | Trace knowledge artifact lineage and sources |

</details>

## The `ao` CLI

The engine behind the skills. Written in Go. Manages knowledge injection, extraction, ratchet gates, and session lifecycle.

```bash
ao inject              # Load prior knowledge into session
ao forge transcript <path>  # Extract learnings from session transcript
ao ratchet status      # Check RPI progress gates
ao ratchet next        # What's the next phase?
ao search "topic"      # Semantic search across knowledge artifacts
ao session close       # Full lifecycle close: forge → extract → promote
ao flywheel status     # Knowledge health — velocity, pool depths
ao hooks install       # Install session hooks for auto-inject/extract
```

## Agent Teams

AgentOps uses Claude Code's native [agent teams](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) — `/council`, `/swarm`, and `/crank` create and manage teams automatically.

```
  Council:                         Swarm:
  ╭─ judge-1 ──╮                  ╭─ worker-1 ──╮
  ├─ judge-2 ──┼→ team lead       ├─ worker-2 ──┼→ team lead
  ╰─ judge-3 ──╯   consolidates   ╰─ worker-3 ──╯   validates + commits
```

**Setup** (one-time):
```json
// ~/.claude/settings.json
{
  "teammateMode": "tmux",
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1"
  }
}
```

| Mode | What you see |
|------|-------------|
| `"tmux"` | Each teammate gets own pane — click to interact |
| `"in-process"` | Single terminal — Shift+Up/Down cycles teammates |
| `"auto"` | Best available (default) |

Requires `tmux` for pane mode (`brew install tmux`).

## Hooks

11 hooks auto-enforce the workflow — no discipline required.

| Hook | Trigger | What it does |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Push gate | `git push` | Blocks push if `/vibe` hasn't passed |
| Worker guard | `git commit` | Blocks workers from committing (lead-only) |
| Dangerous git guard | `force-push`, `reset --hard` | Blocks destructive git commands |
| Ratchet nudge | Any prompt | "Run /vibe before pushing", "Run /pre-mortem first" |
| Task validation | Task completed | Validates metadata before accepting completion |

All hooks have a kill switch: `AGENTOPS_HOOKS_DISABLED=1`.

## Olympus (OL) Integration

AgentOps bridges with the [Olympus CLI](https://github.com/boshu2/olympus) (`ol`) for context orchestration. When `.ol/` is present in a project, AO features auto-enhance:

| Feature | How It Works |
|---------|-------------|
| **Knowledge flow (OL→AO)** | `ol harvest --format=ao` outputs AO-compatible learnings to `.agents/learnings/` |
| **Knowledge flow (AO→OL)** | `ao inject` discovers OL constraints from `.ol/constraints/quarantine.json` |
| **Validation bridge** | `/vibe` runs `ol validate stage1` before council in Olympus projects |
| **Wave→Swarm bridge** | `/swarm --from-wave <json>` reads `ol hero hunt` output, executes tasks, ratchets back to OL |

All OL integrations are guarded — complete no-op when `ol` is not on PATH or `.ol/` is absent. See [docs/ol-bridge-contracts.md](docs/ol-bridge-contracts.md) for the full interchange spec.

## Use Council Standalone

Use `/council` independently — no RPI workflow required, no `ao` CLI, no setup beyond plugin install. Validate any PR, brainstorm approaches, or research decisions with multi-model consensus.

```bash
/council validate this PR                                    # review current changes
/council --deep --preset=security-audit validate the auth system  # thorough security audit
/council brainstorm caching strategies for the API           # explore options with parallel judges
/council research Redis vs Memcached for our use case        # deep-dive technology comparison
```

Works on any codebase, any file, any question. See [skills/council/SKILL.md](skills/council/SKILL.md) for all modes and presets.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Why not just use Claude Code directly?</strong></summary>

Claude Code can spawn agents and write code. AgentOps turns it into an autonomous software engineering system:

- **Goal in, production code out** — `/rpi "goal"` runs 6 phases hands-free. You don't prompt, approve, or babysit.
- **Self-correcting** — Failed validation triggers retry with failure context, not human escalation. The system fixes its own mistakes.
- **Can't regress** — Brownian ratchet locks progress after each phase. Parallel agents generate chaos; multi-model council filters it; ratchet keeps only what passes.
- **Fresh context every time** — Ralph loops: each wave gets a new team, each worker gets clean context. No accumulated hallucinations, no bleed-through between tasks.
- **Gets smarter** — Knowledge flywheel: every session forges learnings into `.agents/`. Next session injects them. Your agents compound intelligence across sessions.
- **Cross-vendor** — `--mixed` mode adds Codex judges alongside Claude. Different models catch different bugs.
- **Self-enforcing** — Hooks block pushes without validation, prevent workers from committing, nudge agents through the lifecycle. No discipline required.

<details>
<summary><strong>What data leaves my machine?</strong></summary>

Nothing. All state lives in `.agents/` (git-tracked, local). No telemetry, no cloud sync, no external services. Your knowledge stays yours.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Do I need the ao CLI?</strong></summary>

Skills work without it. The CLI adds automatic knowledge injection/extraction, ratchet gates, and session lifecycle management. Recommended for full-lifecycle workflows. Install it with `brew install agentops`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does the council actually work?</strong></summary>

`/council` spawns 2–6 parallel judge agents (Claude and/or Codex), each with a different perspective (security, performance, correctness, etc.). Judges deliberate asynchronously, then the lead consolidates into a single verdict: PASS, WARN, or FAIL with specific findings. Built-in presets: `default`, `security-audit`, `architecture`, `research`, `ops`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use this with other AI coding tools?</strong></summary>

AgentOps is a Claude Code plugin — it runs inside Claude Code sessions. The `--mixed` council mode adds Codex (OpenAI) judges alongside Claude for cross-vendor validation. The knowledge flywheel (`.agents/` directory) is plain markdown files that any tool can read.

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I uninstall?</strong></summary>

```bash
npx skills@latest remove boshu2/agentops -g
brew uninstall agentops  # if installed
