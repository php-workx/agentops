## The Problem

AI coding agents are **brilliant but amnesiac**. They solve a bug today, forget it tomorrow. You explain your architecture once, explain it again next week. Every session starts cold.

**AgentOps fixes this.** It gives your agent a persistent, git-tracked memory that compounds over time.

## How It Works

### The Physics: What's a Brownian Ratchet?

In physics, a **Brownian ratchet** extracts useful work from random thermal motion. Molecules bounce around chaotically, but a clever mechanism (the ratchet) only allows movement in one direction. Random noise becomes forward progress.

**AgentOps applies this to AI agents:**

| Physics | AgentOps |
|---------|----------|
| Random molecular motion | Chaotic exploration, trial and error |
| Ratchet mechanism | Validation gates (vibe checks) |
| Forward-only movement | Knowledge that persists and compounds |
| Thermal equilibrium | Session amnesia (what we're escaping) |

**The formula:** `Chaos + Filter + Ratchet = Progress`

```

| Step | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| **Session Start** | Hooks inject relevant knowledge from past sessions |
| **/research** | Mine your knowledge base before diving in |
| **/plan** | Break work into tracked issues with dependencies |
| **/pre-mortem** | Simulate failures *before* they happen |
| **/crank** | Autonomous loop: implement → validate → commit → repeat |
| **/post-mortem** | Extract learnings, index for future sessions |

**The flywheel:** Each cycle feeds the next. Knowledge compounds.

## Installation

**Note:** Installation differs by platform. Claude Code has a built-in plugin system. Codex and OpenCode require manual setup.

### Claude Code (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Install the CLI
brew install boshu2/agentops/agentops

# 2. Initialize your repo
ao init

# 3. Install hooks (this is where the magic happens)
ao hooks install

# 4. Verify
ao badge
```

### Codex

Tell Codex:

```
Fetch and follow instructions from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boshu2/agentops/refs/heads/main/.codex/setup.md
```

### OpenCode

Tell OpenCode:

```
Fetch and follow instructions from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boshu2/agentops/refs/heads/main/.opencode/setup.md
```

### Verify Installation

The hooks should fire automatically. Check that knowledge injection works:

```bash
# Start a Claude Code session - you should see injected context
claude

# Or manually test
ao inject --dry-run
```

---

## What Each Phase Does

| Phase | What Happens | Output |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| **Research** | Mine prior knowledge, explore codebase, synthesize findings | `.agents/research/` |
| **Plan** | Define spec, create tracked issues with dependencies | `.beads/` issues |
| **Pre-Mortem** | Simulate failures before they happen, update spec | Hardened spec |
| **Crank** | Autonomous loop: implement → validate → commit → repeat | Merged code |
| **Post-Mortem** | Extract learnings, validate against spec and goal | `.agents/learnings/` |

---

## How It's Automated

You don't manually run `ao` commands. Hooks do it for you.

```

**SessionStart**: Injects relevant prior knowledge (weighted by freshness + utility)

**SessionEnd**: Extracts learnings and indexes them for future sessions

## The Escape Velocity Equation

Knowledge decays without reinforcement. But when retrieval × usage exceeds decay, knowledge compounds.

```
WITHOUT AGENTOPS (Groundhog Day)
================================
Session 1        Session 2        Session 3
+-----------+    +-----------+    +-----------+
| Debug bug | -> | Same bug  | -> | Same bug  |
|           |    | start over|    | start over|
+-----------+    +-----------+    +-----------+
    2 hr             2 hr             2 hr         = 6 hours

WITH AGENTOPS (Compounding Knowledge)
=====================================
Session 1        Session 2        Session 3
+-----------+    +-----------+    +-----------+
| Debug bug | -> | Recall    | -> | Instant   |
| + capture |    | pattern   |    | recall    |
+-----------+    +-----------+    +-----------+
    2 hr            3 min           30 sec        = 2 hours total
```

**The Math:**

```
dK/dt = I(t) - δK + σρK

Where:
  δ = 0.17/week    (knowledge decay rate)
  σ = retrieval effectiveness
  ρ = citation rate

Goal: σ × ρ > δ → Knowledge compounds faster than it fades
```

|---------|--------|---------|
| **Knowledge Decay** | Darr, Argote & Epple (1995) | Organizational knowledge depreciates ~17%/week without reinforcement |
| **Memory Reinforcement** | Ebbinghaus (1885) | Each retrieval strengthens memory and slows future decay |
| **MemRL** | Zhang et al. (2025) | Two-phase retrieval (semantic + utility) enables self-evolving agents |

## Optional: Parallel Execution

For larger projects, **gastown** enables parallel agent execution:

```
/crank (single agent) --> gastown (multiple polecats in parallel)
```

Each polecat works in isolation. CI validates. Passing work merges. Failures don't cascade.
