**Your AI agent has amnesia. Let's fix that.**

## The Workflow: 5 Commands

This is all you do. Everything else is automatic.

```
/research → /plan → /pre-mortem → /crank → /post-mortem
```

| Step | Command | What Happens | Calls Internally |
|------|---------|--------------|------------------|
| 1 | `/research` | Explore codebase, mine prior knowledge | — |
| 2 | `/plan` | Break goal into tracked issues | `/beads` |
| 3 | `/pre-mortem` | Simulate failures before you build | — |
| 4 | `/crank` | Implement → validate → commit loop | `/implement` for each issue |
| 5 | `/post-mortem` | Validate + extract learnings | `/vibe`, `/retro` |

**That's the whole workflow.**

The skills call each other. `/crank` runs `/implement` on each issue. `/post-mortem` runs `/vibe` for validation and `/retro` for knowledge extraction. The flywheel, the math, the linking — all automatic.

---

## What /vibe Validates

**The core question: Does the implementation match the spec?**

`/vibe` is a semantic validator. After `/crank` builds something, `/vibe` checks if what was built actually matches what was planned. It compares the output against the spec and flags mismatches.

Beyond spec validation, it also checks 8 quality aspects:

| Aspect | What It Catches |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Semantic** | Does the code do what the spec says? Docstrings that lie, misleading names |
| **Security** | SQL injection, auth bypass, hardcoded secrets, crypto issues |
| **Quality** | Code smells, dead code, copy-paste, magic numbers |
| **Architecture** | Layer violations, circular deps, god classes, coupling |
| **Complexity** | CC > 10, deep nesting, long functions, too many params |
| **Performance** | N+1 queries, unbounded loops, resource leaks |
| **Slop** | AI hallucinations, cargo cult code, over-engineering |
| **Accessibility** | Missing ARIA, broken keyboard nav, contrast issues |

**The gate:** 0 CRITICAL = pass. 1+ CRITICAL = block until fixed.

Run `/vibe` anytime you want a quality check. It's also built into the workflow — `/post-mortem` calls it automatically and creates follow-up issues for findings.

## The Problem

Your agent solves a bug today. Tomorrow? Same bug, starts from scratch.

**Every session is day one.**

| Approach | Reality |
|----------|---------|
| Spec-driven dev | Specs are discovered during implementation |
| Better prompts | Knowledge dies when the session ends |
| RAG/embeddings | No learning, just lookup |
| Other workflows | Linear, no memory, no compounding |

---

## The Solution

AgentOps captures what your agent learns and feeds it back.

```
Session 1        Session 10       Session 100
+-----------+    +-----------+    +-----------+
|  Debug    |    |  "I've    |    |  Domain   |
|  auth bug |    |  seen     |    |  expert   |
|  (2 hrs)  | -> |  this"    | -> |  instant  |
|           |    |  (10 min) |    |  recall   |
+-----------+    +-----------+    +-----------+
```

**The math:** Knowledge decays ~17%/week. AgentOps retrieval > decay = compounding.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install CLI
brew tap boshu2/agentops https://github.com/boshu2/homebrew-agentops
brew install agentops

# 2. Install Plugin
claude plugin marketplace add boshu2/agentops
claude plugin install agentops

# 3. Initialize (in your project)
ao init && ao hooks install
```

**That's it.** Hooks handle knowledge capture automatically.

## How It Works

```
     CHAOS              FILTER              RATCHET
   (explore)          (validate)        (lock progress)
       │                  │                   │
       ▼                  ▼                   ▼
  ┌─────────┐        ┌─────────┐        ┌─────────┐
  │/research│───────▶│  /vibe  │───────▶│  commit │

  └─────────┘             │                  │
       ▲                  │ (fail)           │
       └──────────────────┘                  │
                                             ▼
                                      ┌───────────┐
                                      │ .agents/  │──▶ next session
                                      │ (memory)  │
                                      └───────────┘
```

**The Brownian Ratchet:** Chaos generates options. Validation filters. Ratchet locks progress. Knowledge compounds.

## What Gets Captured

Everything lives in `.agents/` — git-tracked, portable, yours.

```
.agents/
├── learnings/     # "Auth bugs usually come from token refresh"
├── patterns/      # "Here's how we handle retries in this codebase"
├── research/      # Deep dive outputs
├── specs/         # Validated specifications
└── retros/        # Session retrospectives
```

**Hooks run automatically:**
- **SessionStart** → Injects relevant prior knowledge
- **SessionEnd** → Extracts and indexes learnings

You don't run `ao` commands manually. The flywheel turns itself.

---

## The Compound Effect

```
WITHOUT AGENTOPS
================
Session 1     Session 2     Session 3     Session 4
[2 hours] --> [2 hours] --> [2 hours] --> [2 hours]  = 8 hours
  (same problem, every time)

WITH AGENTOPS
=============
Session 1     Session 2     Session 3     Session 4
[2 hours] --> [10 min]  --> [2 min]   --> [instant]  = ~2.2 hours
  (learn)      (recall)     (refine)     (mastered)
```

**By session 100, your agent knows:**
- Every bug you've ever fixed
- Your architecture decisions and why
- Your team's coding patterns
- What approaches failed and why
