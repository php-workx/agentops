# AgentOps Plugin Manifest

A marketplace for Claude Code plugins. Start with `vibe-kit` for a production-ready workflow, or build your own.

## Quick Start

/plugin install boshu2/agentops/vibe-kit
```

## Available Plugins

### vibe-kit (Recommended)

A lean, production-ready Claude Code setup built on the 40% rule.

| Component | Count | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Commands | ~10 | Core workflows: `/research`, `/crank`, `/implement`, `/retro` |
| Skills | ~15 | Auto-triggered context: beads, research, voice |
| Agents | 4 | Parallel specialist review: security, architecture, quality, UX |
| CLAUDE.md | 1 | Universal config template |

**Philosophy:** Simple beats clever. Skills replaced most agents. Stay under 40% context utilization.
