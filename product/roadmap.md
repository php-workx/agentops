- **Phase 2 (Community):** Grow adoption, validate universality
- **Phase 3 (Validation):** Prove patterns work across all domains
- **Phase 4 (Enterprise):** Scale to production, add enterprise features
- **Phase 5 (Platform):** Evolve into comprehensive agent operations platform

**Core Philosophy:** Start with solid foundation (constitutional governance, universal patterns, proven results). Build community (profiles, case studies, contributions). Scale thoughtfully (enterprise features, advanced capabilities). Evolve continuously (platform vision, AI-powered improvements).

**Success = Universal adoption of AgentOps patterns as standard operating model for AI agents.**
