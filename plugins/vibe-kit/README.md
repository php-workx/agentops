# vibe-kit

A lean, production-ready Claude Code setup built on the 40% rule.

**Philosophy:** Simple beats clever. Skills replaced most agents. Complexity is where tokens go to die.

## What's Included

| Component | Count | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Commands | 9 | Core workflows: `/research`, `/crank`, `/implement`, `/retro` |
| Skills | 15 | Auto-triggered context: beads, research, validation |
| Agents | 4 | Parallel specialist review: security, architecture, quality, UX |
| Template | 1 | CLAUDE.md starter template |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone to your plugins directory
git clone https://github.com/boshu2/agentops.git ~/.claude/plugins/agentops

# Copy vibe-kit to your .claude/
cp -r ~/.claude/plugins/agentops/plugins/vibe-kit/* ~/.claude/

# Or symlink for updates
ln -s ~/.claude/plugins/agentops/plugins/vibe-kit/commands/* ~/.claude/commands/
ln -s ~/.claude/plugins/agentops/plugins/vibe-kit/skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
ln -s ~/.claude/plugins/agentops/plugins/vibe-kit/agents/* ~/.claude/agents/
```

## The 40% Rule

The most important thing in this plugin:

- **Below 40% context** → 98% success rate
- **Above 60% context** → 24% success rate

Above 40%, the model doesn't degrade. It lies.

### How to stay under 40%

1. Don't load everything at startup
2. Use skills with JIT (just-in-time) loading
3. Compact frequently—write summaries to files, start fresh sessions
4. Kill agents that return too much context

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/research` | Deep codebase exploration |
| `/crank` | Autonomous epic execution |
| `/implement` | Single issue work |
| `/retro` | Extract learnings |
| `/plan` | Create implementation plan |
| `/formulate` | Create reusable formula template |
| `/doc` | Generate documentation |
| `/vibe` | Semantic validation |
| `/status` | Quick status check |

## Skills

Skills auto-trigger on phrases. You don't invoke them—they fire for you.

| Skill | Triggers |
|-------|----------|
| `beads` | "what's ready", "create task", "show blockers" |
| `sk-research` | "research this", "explore the codebase" |
| `sk-implement` | "implement this", "work on task" |
| `sk-crank` | "execute this", "run crank" |
| `sk-vibe` | "validate code", "run vibe" |
| `sk-product` | "product brief", "who is this for" |
| ... | 9 more specialized skills |

## Agents

Four domain experts for parallel review:

| Agent | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| `security-expert` | OWASP Top 10, vulnerabilities |
| `architecture-expert` | System design, cross-cutting concerns |
| `code-quality-expert` | Complexity, patterns |
| `ux-expert` | Accessibility, user-facing |

**When to use agents:** Only for parallel specialist review before merge. If you're not doing parallel review, you probably don't need custom agents.

## CLAUDE.md Template

Copy `CLAUDE.md.template` to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and adapt it:

```bash
cp ~/.claude/plugins/agentops/plugins/vibe-kit/CLAUDE.md.template ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
```

Keep it under 500 lines. Anything longer and you're wasting context.
