# Changelog

All notable changes to the AgentOps marketplace will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.2.1] - 2026-02-10

### Added

- **`ao pool ingest`** — New command to ingest `.agents/knowledge/pending/*.md` learnings into `.agents/pool/` candidates with stable IDs and preserved timestamps.
- **`ao flywheel close-loop`** — New orchestration command chaining: `pool ingest → auto-promote (promote) → promote-anti-patterns → store --categorize`.
- **Codex session-end equivalent** — `~/.codex/agentops/.codex/agentops-codex session-end` for manual close-loop on Codex (since Codex has no native Stop hook).

### Changed

- **`ao pool auto-promote`** — Added `--promote` mode to stage and promote eligible silver/gold candidates into `.agents/learnings/` / `.agents/patterns/`.
- **`ao store` indexing** — Added `--categorize` to capture `category` and `tags` metadata in index entries.
- **Codex bootstrap/install docs** — Updated `.codex/agentops-bootstrap.md` and `.codex/INSTALL.md` with session-end workflow and usage.

### Fixed

- **Stop hook close-loop wiring** — `hooks/hooks.json` Stop hook now executes flywheel close-loop and logs failures to `.agents/ao/hook-errors.log`.
- **Codex compatibility fallback** — `agentops-codex session-end` falls back to repo-local `go run ./cmd/ao` when system `ao` is missing/outdated.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-02-10

### Added

- **RPI Gate 4 iteration loop** — `/rpi` now loops after post-mortem failure instead of stopping, feeding failure context back into the retry
- **Standards security and documentation sections** — Security Practices and Documentation Standards added to Go, Python, Rust, JSON, YAML language references
- **Skill tier frontmatter** — All 32 skills now declare `tier:` in YAML frontmatter for taxonomy validation
- **Council validation script** — `skills/council/scripts/validate-council.sh` (308 lines) validates schema, presets, personas, and output format
- **Skill linting** — `tests/skills/lint-skills.sh` validates tier, triggers, and tool declarations across all skills
- **5 SKILL.md extractions into references/** — Council, crank, implement, swarm, and vibe moved detailed content into progressive-disclosure reference files, keeping SKILL.md lean
- **Documentation validation test suite** (ag-o80) — Three CI-ready scripts preventing doc drift: link validation, skill count assertion, CLI reference generation
- **INDEX.md, GLOSSARY.md, workflows guide, CLI reference** (ag-qmd) — 83-link documentation index, 30-term glossary, workflow decision matrix, 35-command CLI reference
- **Hook execution integration tests** (ag-ab6) — 26 tests in `tests/hooks/test-hooks.sh` covering prompt-nudge, push-gate, and task-validation-gate (JSON injection resistance, kill switches, allowlist enforcement)
- **Skill dependency validation** — `validate-skill.sh` and `run-all.sh` now check declared dependencies exist and report health summary
- **Standards gap fills** (ag-ab6) — TypeScript Testing, Python Security, Rust Security + Documentation, Go Documentation sections added
- **Quickstart monorepo detection** — Shallow scan with trigger paths and dirty-tree-first recent file selection for better onboarding heuristics

### Changed

- **README intro rewrite** — New "What Is AgentOps" section, prerequisites table, 3 install options ordered by ease, FAQ updated for multi-agent compatibility (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor, Open Code)
- **install.sh agent gate softened** — Hard `exit 1` on missing `claude` CLI replaced with warning that checks `claude`/`codex`/`cursor` and continues
- **Vibe skill restructured** — Excess inline content moved to `references/` for progressive disclosure
- **Project tagline** updated to describe full product value

### Fixed

- **Security: command injection in task-validation-gate.sh** — Replaced `/bin/sh -c "$cmd"` with allowlist-based array execution; only `go`, `pytest`, `npm`, `npx`, `make`, `bash` permitted
- **Security: regex injection in task-validation-gate.sh** — Changed `grep -q` to `grep -qF` for literal pattern matching
- **Security: JSON injection in prompt-nudge.sh** — Replaced `printf` JSON construction with `jq -n --arg` for safe escaping
- **stop-team-guard** only blocks when tmux panes are alive (no longer blocks on dead panes)
- **bd doctor warnings** — Sync, config, hooks, gitignore issues resolved
- **Skill count accuracy** — 33→32 across ARCHITECTURE.md, README.md, CLAUDE.md, SKILL-TIERS.md, marketplace.json
- **Vibe flag documentation contradiction** — Clarified default is `--deep` (3 judges), users can override with `--quick` or `--mixed`
- **Phantom `ao export-constraints`** marked as FUTURE in ol-bridge-contracts.md
- **Dual schema confusion in push-gate.sh** — Added CANONICAL/LEGACY comments for `gate`/`status` vs `step`/`locked` fields
- **7 doc inaccuracies** across README.md, SKILL-TIERS.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, profiles docs
- **5 broken links** in meta-observer README replaced with inline descriptions
- **CLAUDE.md skill count** and **SKILL-TIERS.md header count** corrected to match actual (22 user-facing, 10 internal)
- **curl-pipe pattern** removed from install.sh comment to pass security scan

### Removed

- **Deprecated `/judge` skill** — `skills/judge/` directory removed; all references updated to `/council`
- **Stale repo root files** — REBRAND-COORDINATION.md, RELEASE-NOTES.md, prompts/witness_prompt.txt
- **Olympus integration section** removed from README (bridge documented in ol-bridge-contracts.md)

- **`ol harvest --format=ao`** — OL harvest outputs AO-compatible learning markdown (in OL repo)

## [2.0.0] - 2026-02-09

### Added

- **`/rpi` lifecycle skill** — One command, full lifecycle. Research → Plan → Pre-mortem → Crank → Vibe → Post-mortem. Give it a goal, get production code with multi-model validation at every gate. Autonomous by default — zero human prompts. Failed validations trigger retry loops with failure context, not escalation.
- **`--auto` is now the default for `/rpi`** — Just type `/rpi "goal"` and walk away. Use `--interactive` if you want human gates at research and plan phases. `--auto` flag kept for backwards compatibility.
- **`--auto` mode for `/research` and `/plan`** — Sub-skills now accept `--auto` to skip human approval gates. Enables fully autonomous `/rpi` pipeline.

### Changed

- **README rewritten** — New tagline: "Goal in, production code out." Restructured narrative flow, meaningful metric badges, progressive disclosure, expanded FAQ and examples.
- **Plugin description updated** — Reflects autonomous execution positioning.

### Fixed

- **README ao CLI docs accuracy** — Removed false claim that `ao inject` uses decay weighting by default (requires `--apply-decay` flag). Fixed `ao forge transcript` example to show it takes a file path argument.

## [1.9.1] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed

- **`ao hooks install` generates invalid format for Claude Code 2.1+** — Hook entries used old `{matcher, command: []}` format; now generates correct `{hooks: [{type: "command", command: "..."}]}` matcher format. Detection and merge logic handles both old and new formats for backwards compatibility.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added

- **Flywheel automation CLI** (ag-m0r) — 4 new `ao` commands that replace fragile bash parsing in hooks with structured JSON output
  - `ao ratchet next` — Compute next RPI step from chain.jsonl state, with skill suggestion and lock detection
  - `ao flywheel nudge` — Single-command dashboard combining flywheel metrics, ratchet state, and pool status for session-start hook
  - `ao forge batch --extract` — Scan and process pending transcripts with forged-index deduplication and optional extraction trigger
  - `ao session close` — End-to-end session pipeline: forge transcript, extract learnings, measure flywheel velocity delta, report impact
- **Hook CLI integration** — `session-start.sh` and `ratchet-advance.sh` now use `ao` commands with version detection and full fallback paths for backward compatibility
- **Integration tests** — 836 lines covering full pipeline lifecycles (ratchet progression, forge batch dedup, session close, cross-command consistency)

## [1.8.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added

- **Flywheel automation hooks** (ag-oke) — RPI lifecycle hooks that nudge agents through the knowledge flywheel without forcing invocation
  - `ratchet-advance.sh` — PostToolUse hook detects `ao ratchet record` and suggests next RPI skill via additionalContext
  - `session-start.sh` ratchet resume — Reads chain.jsonl on new session, injects "RESUMING FLYWHEEL" directive with last step + artifact
  - `push-gate.sh` post-mortem gate — Blocks push when vibe exists but no post-mortem entry
  - `prompt-nudge.sh` nudge dedup — Flag-file coordination with 10-min TTL prevents triple-nudging across hooks
- **Safety and enforcement hooks** — 7 new hooks for agent guardrails
  - `dangerous-git-guard.sh` — Blocks force-push, reset --hard, clean -f, branch -D
  - `git-worker-guard.sh` — Blocks git commit/push for swarm workers (lead-only commit pattern)
  - `task-validation-gate.sh` — TaskCompleted hook validates metadata rules before accepting
  - `stop-team-guard.sh` — Prevents orphaned teams on session stop
  - `precompact-snapshot.sh` — Snapshots team state + git status before context compaction
  - `standards-injector.sh` — PreToolUse hook injects language-specific coding standards
  - `pending-cleaner.sh` — Archives stale pending queue entries at session start
- **Skill enhancements** — Metadata verification in `/crank`, wave vibe gate, pre-planning audit in `/plan`, ratchet pre-flight in `/implement`, ratchet post-flight in `/vibe`
- **`/release` skill** — GitHub Release draft with highlights + changelog (added in v1.7.0, enhanced with `--no-gh-release` and release notes generation)
- **README** — Reorganized skill catalog by category (orchestration, workflow, utilities, internal)

### Fixed

- Replace `eval()` with restricted execution in task-validation-gate.sh (command injection vulnerability)
- Add missing kill switch (`AGENTOPS_HOOKS_DISABLED`) to standards-injector.sh
- Remove `set -euo pipefail` from session-start.sh (hooks must fail open)
- Fix `--format=oneline` → `-o json` for `ao ratchet status` (flag doesn't exist)
- Fix relative `.agents/ao` path → `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` for correct root detection
- Replace PostToolUse comment-checker with PreToolUse standards-injector (better timing)
- Add failure logging to all ao commands in hooks.json (was bare `|| true`)

### Changed

- **README** — Visual-first rewrite with accurate skill examples
- **Docs** — Reference and L4 updated for native teams + lead-only commits

### Removed

- `comment-checker.sh` — Replaced by standards-injector.sh

## [1.7.1] - 2026-02-07

### Added

- **Hooks system** — 7 hook event types (SessionStart, SessionEnd, PreToolUse, UserPromptSubmit, TaskCompleted, Stop, PreCompact) with 10 scripts covering flywheel pipeline fixes, RPI enforcement gates, and agent team safety
- **Push gate** (`push-gate.sh`) — Blocks `git push`/`git tag` when vibe check not completed. Gates on RPI ratchet state. Cold start = no enforcement.
- **Ratchet-aware nudges** (`prompt-nudge.sh`) — Injects one-liner reminders based on prompt keywords vs ratchet state (e.g., "run /vibe before pushing")
- **Task validation gate** (`task-validation-gate.sh`) — TaskCompleted hook validates metadata.validation rules (files_exist, content_check, tests, lint, command) before accepting task completion
- **Git worker guard** (`git-worker-guard.sh`) — Blocks `git commit`/`push`/`add --all` for swarm workers, enforcing lead-only commit pattern
- **Dangerous git guard** (`dangerous-git-guard.sh`) — Blocks force-push, reset --hard, clean -f, checkout ., branch -D. Suggests safe alternatives.
- **Stop team guard** (`stop-team-guard.sh`) — Prevents orphaned teams by checking for active configs before session stop
- **PreCompact snapshot** (`precompact-snapshot.sh`) — Snapshots team state + git status before context compaction for recovery
- **Standards injector** (`standards-injector.sh`) — PreToolUse hook injects language-specific coding standards before Write/Edit
- **Pending cleaner** (`pending-cleaner.sh`) — Archives stale pending queue entries (>2 days) at session start
- **Ratchet pre-flight** in `/implement` — Checks pre-mortem status before coding starts
- **Ratchet post-flight** in `/vibe` — Records vibe completion in ratchet chain on PASS/WARN
- **README** — Reorganized skill catalog by category (orchestration, workflow, utilities, internal)

### Fixed

- Replace `eval()` with restricted execution in task-validation-gate.sh (command injection)
- Add missing kill switch to standards-injector.sh
- Remove `set -euo pipefail` from session-start.sh (hooks must fail open)
- Fix `--format=oneline` to `-o oneline` for ao ratchet status
- Fix relative `.agents/ao` path to use `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`
- Replace PostToolUse comment-checker with PreToolUse standards-injector
- Add failure logging to all ao commands in hooks.json (was bare `|| true`)

### Removed

- `comment-checker.sh` — Replaced by standards-injector.sh

## [1.7.0] - 2026-02-07

### Added

- **`bin/ralph`** — Full RPI loop script (Goal → Plan → Pre-mortem → Crank → Vibe → Post-mortem → PR). Each phase gets a fresh Claude context window (Ralph Wiggum pattern). Features: `--dry-run`, `--skip-pre-mortem`, `--branch`, `--spec` for acceptance criteria, `--resume` for checkpoint/resume, `--max-budget` and `--phase-timeout` for gutter detection.
- **`/codex-team` skill** — Spawn parallel Codex execution agents from Claude. Claude orchestrates task decomposition, Codex agents execute independently via `codex exec --full-auto`. Includes pre-flight checks, canonical command form, prompt guidelines, and fallback to `/swarm`.
- **`/codex-team` file-conflict prevention** — Team lead analyzes file targets before spawning: same-file tasks merge into one agent, dependent tasks sequence into waves with context injection, different-file tasks run in parallel. The orchestrator IS the lock manager.
- **`/release` skill** — General-purpose release workflow: pre-flight validation (`--check` mode), changelog generation from git history, semver suggestion from commit classification, version bump detection across ecosystems (package.json, pyproject.toml, Cargo.toml, go files), release commit, annotated tag, and optional draft GitHub Release. Boundary at the git tag — everything local and reversible.

### Crank All Epics (ag-kmk, ag-e0g, ag-ow7)

Autonomous execution of 19 issues across 3 epics in 3 waves (18 parallel workers, ~16 minutes, 100% success rate, zero retries).

#### Skills Hardening (ag-kmk + ag-e0g)

- **Structured SendMessage envelope** — JSON envelope schema for machine-parseable team communication (completion, blocked, retry, progress, verdict types)
- **Conflict resolution algorithm** — Severity escalation, deduplication, quorum rules, verdict computation, contradiction handling (`.agents/specs/conflict-resolution-algorithm.md`)
- **Pre-flight checks** — Added to vibe, post-mortem, and crank: verify git repo, files exist, epic has children before spawning agents
- **Native-teams fallback bundle** — Per-capability degradation table in `skills/shared/SKILL.md`; graceful fallback when specific team features unavailable
- **Race-free swarm claiming** — Mayor assigns tasks before spawning; workers only transition status (no concurrent claim races)
- **Anti-anchoring debate protocol** — R2 judges restate their R1 position before reading others' verdicts; weak flip detection in consolidation
- **Lead-only commit policy** — Workers write files, never `git commit`; team lead validates and commits per wave
- **Validation contract updated** — Default validation checks worker-reported artifacts, not commit history
- **Reaper cleanup pattern** — Graceful team shutdown sequence (shutdown_request → wait → TeamDelete) with configurable timeouts
- **Agent timeout and partial completion** — Worker timeout (180s), quorum handling for partial council results

#### ao CLI Quality (ag-ow7)

- **Shell completion** — `ao completion bash|zsh|fish` for tab-complete support
- **`ao forge batch`** — Scan and process pending transcripts in bulk with deduplication
- **`ao pool batch-promote`** — Bulk promote pending candidates meeting criteria (age >24h, cited, not duplicate)
- **File splits** — `ratchet.go` (1001→11 files), `metrics.go` (930→5 files), `inject.go` (891→5 files) for maintainability

### Fixed

- **Batch dedup false positives** — Replaced naive 80-char and 200-char prefix truncation in `normalizeForDedup` and `normalizeContent` with SHA256 content hashing. Distinct learnings with similar openings are no longer silently deduplicated.
- **Batch command test coverage** — Added `batch_forge_test.go` and `batch_promote_test.go` covering dedup logic, promotion criteria, citation counting, transcript discovery, and content loading.
- **Council findings** — Vibe always uses `--deep` (3 judges), debate enabled in post-mortem, auto-escalation when preset specifies more perspectives than judge count.

### Changed

- **Council redesign** — Independent judges by default (no perspective labels); diversity from sampling, not personality. Specialized presets (`code-review`, `plan-review`, `retrospective`) used by wrapper skills (`/vibe`, `/pre-mortem`, `/post-mortem`).
- **Codex model updated to `gpt-5.3-codex`** — All references across council, shared, and SKILL-TIERS updated from `gpt-5.3` to `gpt-5.3-codex` (canonical Codex model name).
- **README rewrite** — 479→149 lines. Leads with value prop, moved architecture and deep docs to `docs/reference.md`.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-02-06

### Adoption Improvements

Driven by council analysis (3 judges + 6 explorers) and pre-mortem validation (2 judges, unanimous WARN → fixes applied).

#### README Overhaul

- **Tagline reframed** — "DevOps for AI agents" → "A knowledge flywheel for AI coding agents — your agent remembers across sessions." Leads with the differentiator (knowledge compounding), not the analogy
- **Tier table added** — Tier 0 (skills only) through Tier 3 (cross-vendor consensus) with graduation triggers. Uses "Tier" naming to avoid collision with existing L1-L5 learning path
- **What This Is reframed** — Flywheel narrative leads ("each session feeds the next"), ASCII diagram preserved in `<details>` block
- **Quick Start rewritten** — Self-contained with commands and context. `/quickstart` offered as optional guided tour (not primary path, due to known slash-command discoverability bug)
- **CLI Reference expanded** — MemRL retrieval, confidence decay, provenance tracking, escape velocity metrics. Leads with capabilities, not LOC count
- **"Why Agents Need DevOps" → "Why Agents Need This"** — Consistent with tagline reframe

#### Tier/Level Disambiguation

- **`docs/levels/README.md`** — Added "Tiers vs Levels" section explaining the two axes: Tiers (0-3) = what tools you install, Levels (L1-L5) = what concepts you learn. Cross-references README tier table
- **`skills/quickstart/SKILL.md`** — Added graduation hints to Step 7 based on detected CLI state (ao, beads presence). Natural language, not formal tier labels

### Native Teams Migration

**The big idea:** Council judges and swarm workers are no longer fire-and-forget background agents. They now spawn as teammates on native teams (`TeamCreate` + `SendMessage` + shared `TaskList`), enabling real-time coordination without re-spawning.

#### Council

- **Judges spawn as teammates** on a `council-YYYYMMDD-<target>` team instead of independent `Task(run_in_background=true)` calls
- **Debate R2 via SendMessage** — judges stay alive after R1 and receive other judges' full verdicts via `SendMessage`. No more re-spawning fresh R2 instances with truncated R1 summaries. Result: zero truncation loss, no spawn overhead, richer debate
- **Team cleanup** — `shutdown_request` each judge + `TeamDelete()` after consolidation
- **Communication rules** — judges message team lead only (prevents anchoring); no peer-to-peer, no TaskList access
- Updated architecture diagram with Phase 1a (Create Team) and Phase 3 (Cleanup)
- R2 output files unchanged (`.agents/council/YYYY-MM-DD-<target>-claude-{perspective}-r2.md`)

#### Swarm

- **Team-per-wave** — each wave creates a new team (`swarm-<epoch>`), preserving Ralph Wiggum fresh-context isolation
- **Workers as teammates** — workers join the wave team, claim tasks via `TaskUpdate`, and report via `SendMessage`
- **Retry via SendMessage** — failed workers receive retry instructions on their existing context (no re-spawn needed within a wave)
- **Workers access TaskList** — workers can claim and update their own tasks (previously Mayor had to reconcile everything)
- Step 5a added: team cleanup (`shutdown_request` workers + `TeamDelete`) after each wave

#### Crank

- **Diagram updated** to show swarm's team-based execution flow (`TeamCreate` per wave, `SendMessage` for reporting, `TeamDelete` after wave)
- Separation of concerns clarified: Crank = beads-aware orchestration, Swarm = team-based parallel execution

#### Shared

- **Native teams fallback** added to CLI availability/fallback table: if `TeamCreate` unavailable, fall back to `Task(run_in_background=true)` fire-and-forget
- Fallback degrades gracefully: council loses debate-via-message (reverts to R2 re-spawn with truncation), swarm loses retry-via-message (reverts to re-spawn)

### Hardening (ag-3p1)

Fixes from council validation of the native teams migration:

- **Codex model pre-flight** — council now tests model availability (not just CLI presence) before spawning Codex agents. Catches account-type restrictions (e.g. gpt-5.3-codex on ChatGPT accounts) and degrades to Claude-only
- **Debate fidelity marker** — debate reports include `**Fidelity:** full | degraded` so users know if `--debate` ran with full-context native teams or truncated fallback
- **Explicit R2 timeout** — `COUNCIL_R2_TIMEOUT` env var (default 90s) replaces vague "idle too long" with concrete timeout and fallback-to-R1 instruction
- **TeamDelete() documentation** — clarified that `TeamDelete()` targets the current session's team context; concurrent team scenarios (e.g. council inside crank) documented

### Simplification

Pre-release council validation (2 judges, unanimous WARN) identified over-engineering. Refactored before shipping:

- **Council task types 5 → 3** — merged critique→validate, analyze→research. Keeps validate, research, brainstorm
- **Removed `--perspectives-file`** — presets and `--perspectives="a,b,c"` cover all current use cases. Bring back when someone asks
- **Agent hard cap: MAX_AGENTS=12** — prevents resource bombs from `--mixed --deep --explorers=N` combinations. Pre-flight check errors if exceeded
- **`--debate` restricted to validate mode** — brainstorm and research don't produce PASS/WARN/FAIL verdicts; combining with --debate now errors instead of producing "awkward outputs"
- **`--debate` documented as Ralph exception** — judges intentionally persist across R1/R2 within one atomic invocation. Bounded, documented, justified
- **Distributed mode gated as experimental** — swarm and crank distributed mode (tmux + Agent Mail) labeled experimental. Local mode (native teams) is the recommended path
- **Crank validation simplified** — collapsed triple validation (per-task + per-issue + batched) to double (trust swarm + final batched vibe). Per-issue layer was redundant

### Documentation

- Added official Skills installer instructions: `npx skills@latest add boshu2/agentops --all -g`
- Added agent-scoped install example: `npx skills@latest add boshu2/agentops -g -a codex -s '*' -y`
- Clarified that session hooks are Claude Code plugin functionality (skills remain portable)

## [1.3.1] - 2026-02-01

### Documentation Reality Check

Swarm documentation updated to match tested behavior:

- **TaskCreate API**: Removed invalid `blockedBy` parameter from examples. Dependencies require separate `TaskUpdate(addBlockedBy=[...])` call
- **Terminology**: "crank loops" → "atomic agents" (agents don't loop internally)
- **Monitoring**: Replaced `TaskOutput` polling with automatic `<task-notification>` pattern
- **Agent isolation**: Documented that agents cannot access TaskList/TaskUpdate - Mayor must reconcile
- **Mayor reconciliation**: Added explicit verify → update status → spawn next wave step
- **Prompts**: Simplified from complex loop instructions to atomic task format

Meta-learning: Task decomposition matters. 6 "independent" doc tasks weren't independent - they shared a file. Consolidated to 2 truly parallel tasks.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-02-01

### Pure Claude-Native Swarm

**The big idea:** Why depend on tmux, external scripts, or complex tooling when Claude Code has everything we need built-in?

The `/swarm` skill now uses pure Claude Code primitives:
- `TaskCreate` / `TaskUpdate` / `TaskList` for state management
- `Task(run_in_background=true)` for spawning background agents
- `<task-notification>` for completion callbacks

No tmux sessions. No external scripts. No beads dependency. Just Claude Code.

### Ralph Wiggum Pattern

This release documents WHY the architecture works, based on the [Ralph Wiggum Pattern](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/):

```
Ralph's bash loop:          Our swarm:
while :; do                 Mayor spawns Task → fresh context
  cat PROMPT.md | claude    Mayor spawns Task → fresh context
done                        Mayor spawns Task → fresh context
```

**Key insight:** Each `Task(run_in_background=true)` spawn creates a fresh process with clean context. Making demigods loop internally would cause context to accumulate and degrade - violating Ralph's core principle.

The loop belongs in Mayor (orchestration). Fresh context belongs in demigods (work).

### Changed

- **`/swarm` skill** - Complete rewrite:
  - Removed tmux dependency
  - Removed external script requirements
  - Pure Task tool orchestration
  - Added Ralph Wiggum pattern documentation
  - Wave execution via `blockedBy` dependencies

- **L4-parallelization docs** - Modernized:
  - Updated from `/implement-wave` to `/swarm`
  - Added Ralph Wiggum pattern explanation
  - Demo uses TaskList/TaskUpdate flow

### Technical Details

The swarm loop:

1. Mayor calls `TaskList()` to find ready tasks (pending, no blockers)
2. For each ready task, Mayor spawns: `Task(run_in_background=true, ...)`
3. Claude sends `<task-notification>` when each agent completes
4. Mayor calls `TaskUpdate(status="completed")` for finished tasks
5. This unblocks dependent tasks → next wave becomes ready
6. Repeat until all tasks complete

Each demigod has fresh context. Mayor maintains state via TaskList. Files/commits persist work across spawns.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-01-31

### Parallel Wave Execution

**The big idea:** When you have multiple issues that can run in parallel (no dependencies between them), why run them one at a time?

Before v1.2.0, `/crank` executed issues sequentially - finish one, start the next. Fine for small epics, but painfully slow when you have 10 independent tasks that could run simultaneously.

Now `/crank` detects **waves** - groups of issues with no blockers - and executes them in parallel using subagents. Each issue gets its own isolated agent. Results flow back to the main session.

```
Before (sequential):
  issue-1 → done → issue-2 → done → issue-3 → done
  Time: 3x

After (parallel waves):
  Wave 1: [issue-1, issue-2, issue-3] → 3 subagents in parallel → all done
  Time: 1x
```

**Why max 3 agents per wave?** Context management. Each subagent returns results that accumulate in your session. We tested higher parallelism - context explodes on complex issues. 3 is the sweet spot: meaningful speedup without blowing your context budget.

### How Waves Work

Waves emerge naturally from beads dependencies:

1. **`/plan`** creates issues with `blocks` dependencies
2. Issues with NO blockers = Wave 1 (run in parallel)
3. Issues blocked by Wave 1 = Wave 2 (run after Wave 1 completes)
4. **`bd ready`** returns the current wave - all unblocked issues
5. **`/crank`** takes the wave and dispatches up to 3 subagents

The dependency graph IS your execution plan. No separate "wave configuration" needed.

### Full Pipeline

```
/research → understand the problem
     ↓
/plan → decompose into issues with dependencies
     ↓         (waves form automatically)
/crank → execute waves in parallel
     ↓         Wave 1: [a, b, c] → 3 agents
     ↓         Wave 2: [d, e] → 2 agents
     ↓         Wave 3: [f] → 1 agent
     ↓
/post-mortem → extract learnings
```

### What's Next: Olympus

This parallel wave model is designed for **single-session work** - one Claude session spawning subagents. It's the foundation for something bigger.

**Olympus** (coming soon) will handle true multi-session orchestration: separate Claude sessions, persistent workers, direct context management instead of subagent nesting. The beads dependency graph persists across sessions - that's the ratchet that survives context resets.

### Changed

- **`/crank` skill** - Parallel wave execution:
  - Added `MAX_PARALLEL_AGENTS = 3` limit per wave
  - Step 4 now dispatches subagents in parallel via Task tool
  - FIRE loop updated to show wave model
  - `bd ready` explicitly documented as "returns current wave"

- **`/plan` skill** - Explicit wave formation:
  - Step 7 now shows how to create `blocks` dependencies
  - Added explanation of how waves form from dependencies
  - Clarified that `bd ready` returns parallelizable work

- **L4 implement-wave docs** - Updated max from 8 to 3 agents per wave

### Technical Details

The key instruction for `/crank`:

> **All Task calls for a wave MUST be in a single message to enable parallel execution.**

When Claude sends multiple Task tool calls in one message, they execute concurrently. Sequential messages = sequential execution. This is how we get parallelism without external orchestration.
