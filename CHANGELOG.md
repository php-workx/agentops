## [0.4.0] - 2026-01-25

### Changed
- **Repository restructure** - Professional polish for cleaner organization:
  - Reduced root directories from 22 to 13
  - Consolidated `levels/`, `profiles/`, `reference/`, `templates/`, `workflows/` into `docs/`
  - Renamed `shared/` to `lib/`
  - Deleted `mail/` (empty) and `agents-archived/` (56 obsolete agents)

- **README rewrite** - Minimal and approachable (47 lines vs 350):
  - One install command, 4 key skills, "want more?" section
  - Moved all details to `docs/PLUGINS.md`
  - Progressive disclosure: start simple, discover more as needed

- **Plugin description** - Simplified from verbose to concise:
  - Old: "Complete Knowledge OS for Claude Code - Research/Plan/Implement workflow..."
  - New: "Plugin kits for Claude Code: RPI workflow, validation, multi-agent orchestration"

### Added
- **Thin commands** - 4 command files that delegate to skills:
  - `commands/research.md` → `solo-kit:research`
  - `commands/plan.md` → `core-kit:formulate`
  - `commands/execute.md` → `core-kit:crank`
  - `commands/validate.md` → `vibe-kit:vibe`

- **Session hooks** - `hooks/` directory with:
  - `hooks.json` - SessionStart hook configuration
  - `session-start.sh` - Creates `.agents/` directories, outputs context

- **Multi-platform support**:
  - `.codex/setup.md` - Codex installation instructions
  - `.opencode/setup.md` - OpenCode installation instructions

- **RELEASE-NOTES.md** - User-friendly version highlights

- **docs/PLUGINS.md** - Complete plugin catalog moved from README

- **Marketplace cleanup** - Removed email from author fields, use GitHub username instead

## [0.3.1] - 2026-01-24

### Changed
- **Standardized .agents/ paths** (core-kit v0.2.1, pr-kit v0.1.1) - All skills now use relative `.agents/` paths:
  - Removed `~/gt/.agents/<rig>/` pattern in favor of portable `.agents/`
  - Removed "Phase 0: Rig Detection" sections from all skills
  - Skills affected: research, plan, formulate, product, pre-mortem, retro, post-mortem, implement
  - PR skills affected: pr-research, pr-plan, pr-implement, pr-retro
  - Gas Town-specific skills (gastown-kit, dispatch-kit) retain their specialized paths

- **README mermaid diagrams** - Replaced ASCII art with GitHub-native mermaid:
  - RPI Workflow diagram: `/research → /pre-mortem → /formulate → /crank → /post-mortem`
  - Plan → Crank handoff diagram with pre-mortem and post-mortem
  - Upgrade Path diagram

### Added
- **RAG Formatting Standard** (domain-kit) - New reference for knowledge artifacts:
  - `standards/references/rag-formatting.md` - 200-400 char sections, frontmatter conventions
  - Knowledge Artifact Detection section in standards SKILL.md
  - No `confidence` column rule (query-time, not storage-time)

- **RAG references added** (core-kit) - Knowledge-producing skills now reference RAG standard:
  - research, plan, formulate, pre-mortem, retro, post-mortem

### Fixed
- **retro skill** - Removed incorrect "Confidence" column from Discovery Provenance template:
  - Confidence/relevance are query-time metrics, not storage-time
  - Added reference to RAG formatting standard

## [0.2.3] - 2026-01-24

### Fixed
- **Plugin JSON uniformity** - Standardized all 14 plugin.json files:
  - Added `$schema` to all plugins (was missing from all)
  - Added `license: "MIT"` to 9 plugins that were missing it
  - Added `keywords` array to all plugins for discoverability
  - All plugins now have identical field structure

## [0.2.2] - 2026-01-24

### Added
- **marketplace-release skill** (core-kit v0.1.2) - New skill for releasing Claude Code plugins:
  - Complete release workflow documentation
  - Version bumping guidance
  - Update propagation explanation
  - Common pitfalls and anti-patterns
  - Context mode reference (inline vs fork)

## [0.2.1] - 2026-01-24

### Fixed
- **Marketplace plugin skills** - Applied `context: inline` fix to distributed plugins:
  - `core-kit/crank` (v0.1.1) - Epic execution now sees conversation context
  - `vibe-kit/vibe` (v0.1.2) - Validation now sees conversation context
  - `general-kit/vibe` (v0.1.2) - Validation now sees conversation context
  - Users who install from marketplace now get the fix

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-24

### Fixed
- **Skill context mode** - Changed `context: fork` to `context: inline` for conversation-aware skills:
  - `vibe` - Now has access to chat context for inferring validation targets
  - `crank` - Now can identify epics mentioned in conversation
  - `pre-mortem` - Now can analyze specs discussed in chat
  - `post-mortem` - Now can identify completed epics from conversation
  - Root cause: `context: fork` creates isolated execution without conversation history
  - See `.agents/patches/2026-01-24-skill-context-inline.md` for details

## [0.1.3] - 2026-01-21

### Added
- **Two-Tier Standards Architecture** - JIT loading strategy for language standards:
  - **Tier 1** (slim refs, ~4-5KB): Always loaded via standards skill
  - **Tier 2** (deep standards, ~15-25KB): Loaded with `--deep` flag
  - Languages: Python, TypeScript, Shell, Go, YAML, JSON, Markdown

- **domain-kit v0.1.1** - Tier 1 slim references:
  - `standards/references/python.md` - Quick reference, common errors, prescan checks
  - `standards/references/typescript.md` - Strict mode, ESLint, type patterns
  - `standards/references/shell.md` - Required flags, shellcheck, error handling
  - `standards/references/go.md` - Error patterns, interfaces, concurrency
  - `standards/references/yaml.md` - yamllint, Helm/Kustomize patterns
  - `standards/references/json.md` - Formatting, JSONL, schema validation
  - `standards/references/markdown.md` - AI optimization, structure, tables

- **vibe-kit v0.1.1** - Tier 2 deep standards:
  - `vibe/references/python-standards.md` - Full complexity patterns, compliance grading
  - `vibe/references/typescript-standards.md` - Discriminated unions, branded types
  - `vibe/references/shell-standards.md` - ERR traps, security patterns
  - `vibe/references/go-standards.md` - Custom errors, thread-safe patterns
  - `vibe/references/yaml-standards.md` - Full Helm/Kustomize conventions
  - `vibe/references/json-standards.md` - Configuration patterns, tooling
  - `vibe/references/markdown-standards.md` - AI-agent optimization principles

- **general-kit v0.1.1** - Tier 2 deep standards (zero-dependency version):
  - Same 7 `*-standards.md` files as vibe-kit
  - Standalone operation without beads integration

### Changed
- **vibe SKILL.md** (vibe-kit, general-kit) - Added "Two-Tier Standards Loading" documentation:
  - Explains Tier 1 vs Tier 2 loading behavior
  - Documents `--deep` flag for comprehensive audits
  - Usage examples for different scenarios

### Design Decisions
- **Progressive disclosure**: Tier 1 gives quick answers, Tier 2 provides comprehensive audit capability
- **Context efficiency**: Default validation stays under 40% context budget
- **Portable**: general-kit has same deep standards for zero-dependency environments

## [0.1.2] - 2026-01-20

### Added
- **Tiered Architecture** - Scalable plugin system from solo developer to multi-agent orchestration:
  - **Tier 1**: solo-kit (any developer, any project)
  - **Tier 2**: Language kits (plug in based on project)
  - **Tier 3**: Team workflows (beads-kit, pr-kit, dispatch-kit)
  - **Tier 4**: Multi-agent orchestration (crank-kit, gastown-kit)

- **solo-kit v0.1.2** - Foundation for any developer:
  - 7 skills: `/research`, `/vibe`, `/bug-hunt`, `/complexity`, `/doc`, `/oss-docs`, `/golden-init`
  - 2 agents: `code-reviewer`, `security-reviewer` (read-only review specialists)
  - Hooks: auto-format on save, console.log/debug warnings, git push review, debug audit on session end
  - Zero external dependencies - works with any project

- **python-kit v0.1.2** - Python language support:
  - Standards skill with `references/python.md`
  - Hooks: ruff format, ruff check, mypy type checking

- **go-kit v0.1.2** - Go language support:
  - Standards skill with `references/go.md`
  - Hooks: gofmt, golangci-lint, P13/P14 error handling checks

- **typescript-kit v0.1.2** - TypeScript/JavaScript support:
  - Standards skill with `references/typescript.md`
  - Hooks: prettier, tsc type checking, `any` type warnings

- **shell-kit v0.1.2** - Shell scripting support:
  - Standards skill with `references/shell.md`
  - Hooks: shellcheck, `set -euo pipefail` enforcement

- **ARCHITECTURE-PROPOSAL.md** - Documents the tiered architecture design and migration path

### Changed
- **README.md** - Major update with tiered architecture:
  - Added tiered install instructions
  - Added upgrade path diagram (solo-kit → language-kit → beads-kit → crank-kit → gastown-kit)
  - Clarified legacy plugins and migration targets

- **Argument Inference** - Enhanced `/crank` and `/vibe` to semantically infer targets:
  - `/crank creating beads` now extracts "beads" keyword and searches for matching epic
  - `/vibe the auth changes` now validates auth-related files from git diff
  - Priority: conversational keywords > beads/git discovery > ask user
  - Updated in: core-kit/crank, vibe-kit/vibe, general-kit/vibe

### Skill Counts
| Kit | Skills | Agents | Tier |
|-----|--------|--------|------|
| solo-kit | 7 | 2 | 1 |
| python-kit | 1 (standards) | - | 2 |
| go-kit | 1 (standards) | - | 2 |
